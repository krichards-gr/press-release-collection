LEBANON, Ky. — Spectrum, the #1 rural internet provider in the nation*, today announced the expansion of its fiber broadband network to bring Spectrum Internet, Mobile, TV and Voice services to more than 640 additional homes and businesses in previously unserved or underserved areas of Marion County including locations near Bradfordsville, Gravel Switch and Lebanon.

Our multi-year rural construction initiative is driven by more than $7 billion in private investment from Spectrum and will ultimately add an additional 100,000+ miles of fiber network infrastructure and deliver symmetrical and multi-gigabit speeds to more than 1.7 million new locations across the country.

“Spectrum is bringing gigabit broadband to rural communities in Kentucky and across America,” said Heather Day, Area Vice President for Spectrum’s Kentucky Management Area. “Our investment is providing residents and small businesses superior connectivity at highly competitive prices, backed by a team of skilled local technicians and 100% U.S.-based customer service.”

Local residents and business owners should visit spectrumruralexpansion.com to learn more about when their home or business may be able to receive Spectrum services.

“Spectrum’s latest broadband network expansion is poised to make a huge impact in our community by providing internet access for residents that have long been without,” said State Rep. Sarge Pollock. “From our most rural neighbors to businesses and schools, everyone will benefit from improved connectivity and the associated opportunities it will provide.

Spectrum Internet delivers speeds up to 1 Gbps and Advanced WiFi for residential and business customers, featuring starting speeds of 500 Mbps, with no modem fees, data caps or contracts. The company has also begun a network evolution that will provide gigabit upstream speeds and multiple gigabit download speeds across its entire 41-state service area.

Spectrum Internet exceeded advertised download and upload speeds for all tiers measured — even during peak weeknight usage between 7 and 11 p.m. — according to the FCC’s most recent “Measuring Broadband America Fixed Broadband Report.”

“As a lifelong resident of Marion County, I know how important it is for my friends and neighbors to stay connected with each other as well as life beyond the county line,” said David Daugherty, Marion County Judge Executive. “Spectrum is helping us stay connected in an increasingly digital world through its high-speed internet access with affordability options for those in need.”
