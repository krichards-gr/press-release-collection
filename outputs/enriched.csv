A Front-Row Experience for Lakers Fans

Apple Immersive places viewers at the center of live events and stories as they unfold. Spectrum Front Row in Apple Immersive is directed and produced for Apple Vision Pro with a feed of up to 150mbps and seven unique viewing angles: the scorer’s table, the area beneath each basket, a high-and-wide view of the arena, the player tunnel, the broadcast booth, and a roaming courtside perspective for interviews and commentary. The broadcast team features Emmy Award-winning play-by-play commentator Mark Rogondino and three-time NBA champion and former Lakers forward Danny Green as analyst.

Spectrum Front Row in Apple Immersive brings viewers closer to each pass, shot, and block. In-game graphics, including lower thirds, player rosters, game and shot clocks, and scores, appear in 3D, as if they’re floating directly in front of the viewer. Ambisonic microphones capture Spatial Audio of the arena, so viewers hear the crisp squeaks of sneakers driving up and down the court, the swish of the net when a player drains a three-pointer, and the roar of the crowd during intense moments of gameplay. During timeouts, halftimes, and other breaks in the action, the broadcast remains live inside the arena, showcasing pregame introductions, team huddles, and even in-arena entertainment.

First introduced in 2011, The Opening changed the game for football recruiting, dominating as the nation’s most exclusive regional competition for top high school athletes. Now, after a seven-year hiatus, Nike is bringing back the elite competition — providing athletes an unmatched opportunity to show off their skills, improve their college recruitment status and advance their football and training knowledge.

The Opening will kick off in Miami (January 16) ahead of the College Football Playoff National Championship, and it will include regional events at NFL facilities in six other cities: Los Angeles (February 22), Indianapolis (March 1), Atlanta (March 8), New Orleans (March 22), New York City (April 12) and Dallas (May 24).

Each exclusive event will bring together the region’s top high school football players to see how they stack up against each other in the 40-yard dash, 20-yard shuttle and vertical jump; position-specific drills and competitions; and one-on-one and seven-on-seven matchups.

The best of the best (120 athletes total) will be invited to The Opening Finals at Nike’s Philip H. Knight Campus in Beaverton, Oregon. The three-day experience, held June 24-26, represents the best platform for elite athletes to compete against other top talent from across the country, learn from leading Nike coaches and leave it all on the field — with an opportunity to do their region proud and score a potential NIL deal from Nike in the process.

The Opening will amplify athletes’ recruiting and brand platforms by providing unrivaled opportunities for national exposure: All major national recruiting websites will attend the regional events; data and video will be distributed to coaching staffs from all Power Four programs; and athletes will be able to access their video through Hudl.

Two of the most prominent football creators — Deestroying and AJ Greene — will join Nike on tour, attending each of the regional events to discover which area has the best youth football.

What’s more: Athletes who compete in The Opening will join a storied list of alumni, such as Saquon Barkley, Ja’Marr Chase, Derrick Henry and Patrick Surtain II. Since the program’s inception, 428 alumni have been drafted into the NFL, including 95 first-round selections.

Participants in this year’s events will include top recruits from the class of 2027, as well as standout underclassmen, all competing free of charge. Each athlete will have the opportunity to compete in the most innovative Nike football gear, including cleats, gloves, tops and shorts.

With that many wings in play, Bounty called in NFL legend and longtime partner Rob Gronkowski (aka Gronk), along with his newest wingman, sportscaster, on-air co-host, and real-life friend Charissa Thompson. Together, Gronk and Charissa are giving fans a front-row seat into how they really do gameday at home.

“I go big on game day, big plays, big energy, and a ton of extra saucy wings,” said Gronk. “As the Bounty Man, I know mess happens, so Charissa and I call in Bounty, the only paper towel tough enough to keep the game going.”

“Gronk and I go way back, and while fans might be used to seeing us together on camera, we’ve logged just as much time hanging out at each other’s watch parties,” said Charissa Thompson. “And anyone who has been to a Gronk watch party knows a mess is guaranteed.

According to the National Chicken Council, Americans eat enough wings during the Super Bowl alone to circle the Earth more than three times if laid out end-to-end.* Just imagine the mess.

As the MVP of clean, Bounty is twice as absorbent as ordinary paper towels, so fans can use less and get the job done with just one sheet.**

Enter Rob Gronkowski & Charissa Thompson

With that many wings in play, Bounty called in NFL legend and longtime partner Rob Gronkowski (aka Gronk), along with his newest wingman, sportscaster, on-air co-host, and real-life friend Charissa Thompson. Together, Gronk and Charissa are giving fans a front-row seat into how they really do gameday at home.

“I go big on game day, big plays, big energy, and a ton of extra saucy wings,” said Gronk. “As the Bounty Man, I know mess happens, so Charissa and I call in Bounty, the only paper towel tough enough to keep the game going.”

“Gronk and I go way back, and while fans might be used to seeing us together on camera, we’ve logged just as much time hanging out at each other’s watch parties,” said Charissa Thompson. “And anyone who has been to a Gronk watch party knows a mess is guaranteed. That’s why I’m excited to team up with Bounty so fans can enjoy every part of gameday, the fun, the food and yes, even the mess.”

Bounty Takes Over Super Bowl LX Media Center

It’s game on at Super Bowl Radio Row from February 2 – 6, 2026 at The George R. Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco with the annual Bounty House of Wingman. This year, Bounty takes the watch party experience to the next level with a two-story, 1,200 square foot smart home - anticipated to be an unforgettable standout at the Super Bowl media hub.

The highlights:

Tens of thousands of chicken wings served to hungry reporters

Live interviews, photo ops, and content creation with Gronk, Charissa, and NFL Wingmen

A “front-lawn” football challenge, where attendees can launch footballs through an oversized roll of Bounty and race the clock for a high score

The experience brings together food, fun, football, and of course plenty of Bounty to pick up the mess.

Helping Fans Gear Up for Gameday at Home

And it doesn’t stop there; Bounty is helping fans gear up for their own watch parties at home by offering a limited time coupon for up to $3 off select packs of Bounty starting today, making it easier to stock up and stay ready for the messiest Sunday of the year.

Renewable gasoline blends can become scalable, cost-effective alternatives to traditional fuels with the help of these programs. Advancing public policies will be critical to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of gasoline-powered vehicles on the road today, and for decades to come.

by the numbers

The light-duty sector currently accounts for a staggering 57% of U.S. transportation emissions, and renewable gasoline blends, when supported with ambitious policies, are a path toward reducing this number.

In the U.S., the average passenger vehicle is 12 years old. And the average light-duty automobile remains on American roads for almost 20 years before being decommissioned. This means that vehicles sold in the 2030s will still be on the road in the 2050s.

In Casmalia, California, EMC is remediating a former oil field site where the property is owned by a local family ranch. Early in the process, EMC constructed a steel bridge to provide a safe crossing over an onsite stream. The bridge will continue to serve the working ranch long after EMC’s work is completed, illustrating the strong relationship Chevron has maintained with the family during this site restoration process.

In Questa, New Mexico, at the site of a former century-old molybdenum mine, EMC helped to restore Eagle Rock Lake, a key recreational resource for the local community.

Delivers $300 million in anticipated annual pre-tax synergies

Accretive to ROCE, free cash flow and earnings

SAN RAMON, Calif., July 20, 2020 - Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement with Noble Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ: NBL) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Noble Energy in an all-stock transaction valued at $5 billion, or $10.38 per share. Based on Chevron’s closing price on July 17, 2020 and under the terms of the agreement, Noble Energy shareholders will receive 0.1191 shares of Chevron for each Noble Energy share. The total enterprise value, including debt, of the transaction is $13 billion.

The acquisition of Noble Energy provides Chevron with low-cost, proved reserves and attractive undeveloped resources that will enhance an already advantaged upstream portfolio. Noble Energy brings low-capital, cash-generating offshore assets in Israel, strengthening Chevron’s position in the Eastern Mediterranean. Noble Energy also enhances Chevron’s leading U.S. unconventional position with de-risked acreage in the DJ Basin and 92,000 largely contiguous and adjacent acres in the Permian Basin.

“Our strong balance sheet and financial discipline gives us the flexibility to be a buyer of quality assets during these challenging times,” said Chevron Chairman and CEO Michael Wirth. “This is a cost-effective opportunity for Chevron to acquire additional proved reserves and resources. Noble Energy’s multi-asset, high-quality portfolio will enhance geographic diversity, increase capital flexibility, and improve our ability to generate strong cash flow. These assets play to Chevron’s operational strengths, and the transaction underscores our commitment to capital discipline. We look forward to welcoming the Noble Energy team and shareholders to bring together the best of our organizations.”

“This combination is expected to unlock value for shareholders, generating anticipated annual run-rate cost synergies of approximately $300 million before tax, and it is expected to be accretive to free cash flow, earnings, and book returns one year after close,” Wirth concluded.

“The combination with Chevron is a compelling opportunity to join an admired global, diversified energy leader with a top-tier balance sheet and strong shareholder returns,” said David Stover, Noble Energy’s Chairman and CEO. “Over the last few years, we have made significant progress executing our strategic objectives, including driving capital efficiency gains onshore, advancing our offshore conventional gas developments and significantly reducing our cost structure. As we looked to build on this positive momentum, the Noble Energy Board of Directors and management team conducted a thorough process and concluded that this transaction is the best way to maximize value for all Noble Energy shareholders. We look forward to bringing together our highly complementary cultures and teams to realize the long-term value and benefits that this combination will deliver.”

Low Cost Acquisition of Proved Reserves and Attractive Undeveloped Resource: Based on Noble Energy’s proved reserves at year-end 2019, this will add approximately 18 percent to Chevron’s year-end 2019 proved oil and gas reserves at an average acquisition cost of less than $5/boe, and almost 7 billion barrels of risked resource for less than $1.50/boe.

The acquisition consideration is structured with 100 percent stock utilizing Chevron’s attractive equity currency while maintaining a strong balance sheet. In aggregate, upon closing of the transaction, Chevron will issue approximately 58 million shares of stock. Total enterprise value of $13 billion includes net debt and book value of non-controlling interest.

The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020. The acquisition is subject to Noble Energy shareholder approval. It is also subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

After all, this Midwestern city, strategically positioned in America’s midpoint, hosts the world’s largest railyard. It’s also home to Trego Dugan Aviation (TDA), a true family-run company that’s taken off from modest beginnings on a cattle-pasture, grass runway to become a coast-to-coast force in air cargo services, ground handling, and air charter, while serving as the gateway for golfers seeking Nebraska’s world-class fairways.

Located at North Platte Regional Airport (KLBF), the fixed-base operator (FBO) is living up to its family-focused values and the city’s historical transportation precedent by concentrating intently on driving memorable, hole-in-one customer experiences.

Trego Dugan Aviation’s focus on service excellence has earned it a loyal following in the golf world. Amateur and professional golfers, international celebrities, famous athletes, and even a United States President have flown into Trego Dugan Aviation, eager to experience the rippling, native grass-ringed fairways of Sand Hills Golf Club, an hour’s drive from North Platte.

Hole-in-One Customer Experience

“People fly in here not only for Midcontinent fuel stops, but also to play golf at high-end golf courses, and they come here expecting great service,” explains Scott Baker, General Manager for Trego Dugan Aviation at KLBF, a Phillips 66® branded FBO.

Baker says, “It’s about providing the best, top-notch service – from the guys out on the ramp to our front desk supervisor, who is just amazing.”

That service-focused approach, says Baker, is what draws golfers into Trego Dugan instead of Omaha, Lincoln, Kearney and other Nebraska airports, for easy access to North Platte’s top-ranked courses, including Sand Hills, CapRock Ranch (Golf Digest’s #72, “Greatest Golf Courses”), the Prairie Club Dunes Course (Golf Digest’s #36, “100 Greatest Public Courses”), and GrayBull (“Best New Private Course” by the Robb Report and Golf Digest).

“We pride ourselves on providing excellent service and valuing our customers,” Baker explains. “We try to take care of people the best we can. Whether flying in on a big Gulfstream jet or a single-engine piston aircraft, you’re still going to get the same great service, delivered with a Midwestern work ethic and a commitment to integrity.”

Ask Baker, who’s also a flight instructor for the FBO, about the FBO’s business model, and he’ll say it’s all about family.

“Trego Dugan started as a family company, and it’s still a family company,” Baker explains. “Our culture represents that. We treat our customers like they’re family, we work to make sure they feel valued and appreciated.”

From Livestock to Stocking Aviation Fuel

More than 50 years ago, Gary Trego convinced his cattle-raising dad that he could handle his vital ranch duties all while starting a flight school. His dad flew Super Cubs over the ranch and Gary loved aviation. Gary and his wife, Terry, founded Trego Aviation in 1970, focusing on flight school, FBO operations and aircraft maintenance from a Nebraska ranch with six employees.

It didn’t take long for the budding FBO to trade its cow-pasture landing strip for the 8,000-foot and 4,400-foot concrete runways at KLBF. The company became Trego Dugan Aviation when Gary’s daughter, Traci, and her husband, Vincent Dugan, took over operations.

All three family members share a lifelong love of flying, logging extensive miles as experienced pilots. In fact, when Traci was just 16, before even getting a driver’s license, she earned her pilot’s license from her safety-demanding flight instructor father. Now, as TDA’s Vice President, Flight and Air Cargo Logistics, Traci oversees cargo handling for millions of packages coast-to-coast, facilitating Amazon’s overnight shipping. See TDA Cargo in action at its Nashville facility here.

Vince Dugan leverages his former aviation law practice as TDA’s President, directing a burgeoning national footprint and upwards of 1,000 team members – growth that speaks volumes for a visionary, family-run company with modest beginnings on a Nebraska ranch.

Taking Care of Business

Whether it’s fast quick turns or driving a customer’s forgotten golf clubs, Bakers says his team does everything they can make the FBO and airport a great place to fly into.

Each year, TDA Cargo also handles some 80 million customer packages, while TDA Ground Handling supports over 50,000 commercial flights and TDA Charter manages thousands of private flights, all built on the same customer-first mindset that defines its FBO operations.

“It’s our work culture; the heart of our business is our people,” says Baker. “Our teams are diligent, dedicated and have purpose.”

A longtime Phillips 66® branded FBO, Trego Dugan Aviation keeps safety and security top-of-mind for its NATA Safety 1st-trained team. The FBO relies on the refiner’s safety and fuel handling webinars, staying current with industry best practices, explains Baker. When it comes to fuel, he appreciates Phillips 66’s commitment to quality and, importantly, the company’s responsiveness.

“If we face any issues, we can call someone at Phillips 66® Aviation and it gets resolved immediately,” says Baker. “Our branded sales rep has done an amazing job. It’s been great working with Phillips 66.”

Trego Dugan Aviation is not the flashiest FBO, says Baker. But like seasoned caddies skillfully guiding pro golfers to victory without fanfare, the FBO is attentively focused on helping its customers.

“Come into our FBO, and it’s cozy, you get that warm feeling that people care about you,” he says. “No matter what you fly, we’ll take good care of you.”

Thought leadership

Phillips 66 leaders headed a change leadership session, “The Robots Are Coming: Empowering Teams to Embrace Change,” discussing how technology is reshaping engineering roles and how leaders can guide teams through the transformation.

Panel participants (pictured left to right): Madison Spangler, Sr. Advisor, Innovation and Technology, Midstream Operations; Eileen Naski, Sr. Manager Regulated Scheduling and Optimization, Midstream Operations; Sarah Gall, Managing Director, Optimization and Remote Operations; Tandra Perkins, EVP, Chief Digital and Admin Officer; Moderated by Audrey Bonafede, Sr. Specialist, Remediation Management.

The conversation explored the impact of automation and AI, effective digital change management and how to cultivate a culture that embraces innovation.

Fueling innovation and future growth

Emerging technologies can supercharge productivity, but panel leaders stressed the importance of providing clear boundaries and context so teams can think differently while still maintaining safe, reliable and efficient operations.

Key takeaways

Educate and collaborate: Help employees view automation as an opportunity versus a threat. Provide learning opportunities to understand how to safely put new technologies into practice and explore opportunities to innovate.

Help employees view automation as an opportunity versus a threat. Provide learning opportunities to understand how to safely put new technologies into practice and explore opportunities to innovate.

Kristen Faust, a panelist participant at the Summit, knows firsthand that affordable housing creates more than just shelter—it builds stability. As Executive Director of the Illinois Housing Development Authority, she works to expand access to homeownership and rental housing, helping people find homes they can afford.



But still, individuals and families are being priced out and demand is far outpacing supply. That’s why Faust believes solving the current affordable housing crisis requires a unified effort from government, individuals and the business sector. The $25 million investment from Capital One to expand homeownership in the United States was an “inspirational push” for her and others to keep advancing economic opportunity.



“It's always exciting when we see a financial institution that has national reach want to hold up the work we're doing in community development,” said Faust. “If we're going to have Illinois, or anywhere in the country, be a great place to live, we need those public-private partnerships so everybody can feel they have their shot at the American dream.”

A Bold Investment for National Impact

The $25 million Open Call, sponsored by the Capital One Foundation and the nonprofit Lever for Change, is part of Capital One’s five-year, $265 billion Community Benefits Plan, developed as part of its acquisition of Discover, that will create affordable housing, enable ready and resilient consumers, grow and sustain small businesses, and invest in community infrastructure. In 2024 alone, the company financed nearly $3 billion in affordable housing across the country.



The investment was announced at the two-day summit in Chicago that brought together 200 community, government and industry leaders. Organizations nationwide can submit proposals demonstrating a measurable solution to scale homeownership, strengthen community partnerships and sustain long-term change in the housing ecosystem.



Ten organizations will be selected as finalists and given $200,000 in seed money to refine their plans. Ultimately five groups will be selected as winners, with each receiving $4.6 million.



The Chicago Sun Times noted Chicago’s own efforts to address challenges with affordable housing, sharing: “Chicago and Cook County have been pushing to create more affordable and market-rate housing across the region, like the county’s modular housing pilot program.”



Payments Dive and Forbes further reported on the announcement, with Forbes noting the need for data-driven solutions to tackle the affordable housing crisis, sharing: “[Capital One’s Open Call] reflects a move away from digitizing paperwork toward building intelligent systems that connect people to homes—not someday, but when they are ready.”",neutral

The effort, called Reclaiming Chicago, is transforming Chicago’s South and West Side neighborhoods. Capital One in October announced a $1 million investment to help support the work and grow Reclaiming Chicago’s impact. The coalition has built 90 single-family homes — with a goal of constructing 2,000 — and gives first-time buyers enhanced savings assistance and financial education to succeed



“Capital One’s investment is helping rebuild communities that have been overlooked and disinvested for far too long,” said Raúl Raymundo, Chief Executive Officer of The Resurrection Project, one of the lead organizations of the Reclaiming Chicago initiative. “We’re not just building houses — we’re creating pathways to generational wealth and giving families power over their futures in Chicago.”



Capital One’s Commitment to Chicago

The investment to Reclaiming Chicago builds on years of sustained investment by Capital One in Chicago, and in Illinois more broadly. From 2021 to 2024, Capital One supported the development of more than 2,000 affordable housing units across Illinois, including nearly 1,500 in Chicago alone. Capital One also provided $313 million in capital and services for community development statewide.



Reclaiming Chicago is helping low-to-moderate-income homebuyers in four Chicago neighborhoods that lack affordable housing: Roseland, North Lawndale, Back of the Yards, and Chicago Lawn. The funding from Capital One will go toward building energy-efficient homes, ensuring residents have sustainable housing for years to come



“Chicago is central to Capital One’s business, and this investment reflects our commitment to the city’s future,” said Desiree Francis, Managing Vice President, Head of Community Finance at Capital One. “Reclaiming Chicago demonstrates what's possible when you back community-led solutions with the resources they need — families gain homeownership, neighborhoods gain stability and the entire city benefits.""



Whittney Smith, deputy director and counsel for Lawndale Christian Development Corporation, told Payments Dive that the investment will be essential to help the coalition finish building the 2,000 homes and “get to the level where [Reclaiming Chicago is] truly impacting North Lawndale, Roseland, Back of the Yards, Chicago Lawn and making sure those residents have access to the beautiful, affordable, sustainable housing.”



As part of its $265 billion Community Benefits Plan, Capital One is making significant investments across the country to enable economic opportunity and support the building blocks of financial well-being.



Most recently, in October 2025, Capital One, the Capital One Foundation, and Chicago-based nonprofit Lever for Change announced the launch of Scaling Pathways to Homeownership, a $25 million Open Call designed to identify and support bold solutions that expand access to homeownership in the United States. The grant to Reclaiming Chicago is part of Capital One’s $20 million pledge in philanthropic support to Chicago-based organizations.





About Reclaiming Chicago

Reclaiming Chicago is an initiative of United Power for Action and Justice to build affordable for-sale homes, creating communities of opportunity for working people and rebuilding the City’s core neighborhoods on the South and West Sides by transforming vacant lots and buildings into affordable energy-efficient homes — to replace vacancy, violence, and decades of disinvestment with affordable homes, safe streets, and opportunities for families, especially families of color, to build wealth and equity.

It has also generated the majority of the city’s tax base and revenue. In 2019, downtown’s offices, hotels, bars, restaurants, and retail served some 470,000 workers and a substantial share of the city’s more than 26 million annual visitors. Today, vibrant downtown businesses are key to powering San Francisco’s comeback—the backbone of both its economic and cultural life.

At this critical moment, JPMorganChase is helping the city’s small business owners to get started and grow—just as we’ve done throughout our more than 120 years in San Francisco. “We’re committed to Downtown’s ongoing revitalization,” says Tony Tolentino, JPMC’s Vice President of Global Philanthropy. “And we’re excited to see where this goes: What is the next iteration of Downtown San Francisco?”

A small business makes a big impact

Annie Leong and her husband, Gonzalo Del Cerro, nearly lost their restaurant during the pandemic. Now, with help from JPMorganChase, they’re among the dedicated San Francisco small business owners who are helping downtown to get back on its feet.

In March 2019, Annie and her husband, Gonzalo, opened their cafe, Chalos, in Outer Sunset—the San Francisco neighborhood she’d grown up in. Chalos’s authentic cuisine, including churros made to order and fried empanadas made exactly as they are in Argentina, quickly won an ardent local following. However, less than a year after opening, the onset of the pandemic and subsequent public health restrictions, followed by two and a half years of construction that impeded access to Chalos, Annie and Gonzalo faced an existential challenge: They had put their entire savings into the cafe.

They quickly remade Chalos as a takeout-only restaurant, streamlining operations so that Gonzalo focused on cooking while Annie managed all other aspects of the business. “Thankfully, we have a really loyal clientele that supported us,” says Annie.

After the lockdowns and construction finally ended, Annie and Gonzalo wanted to give back to the city—to be among the first wave of small business owners to bring back to life the millions of square feet of vacant commercial and office space downtown.

Main Street Launch (MSL) was working toward the same objective. For over a decade, the organization has provided small businesses in San Francisco with loan capital, technical assistance, and thoughtful guidance with such matters as leasing, business formation, budgeting, and marketing. In fact, MSL had provided support and guidance to Annie and Gonzalo twice before—first, at the time of Chalos’s opening, then during the pandemic, with a COVID recovery loan.

When she and Gonzalo began thinking of opening a second Chalos, Annie reached out for advice to MSL’s Executive Vice President, Karla De Leon, with whom she had a strong working relationship. Karla told her that MSL had just launched the Downtown San Francisco Vibrancy Loan Fund (DVLF).

Seeded with an initial philanthropic investment of $1.2 million from JPMorganChase, the DVLF targets entrepreneurs starting or expanding small businesses in designated downtown San Francisco communities. These investments provide essential working capital to sustain and expand operations, hire and retain staff, beautify spaces, and expand product offerings. JPMorganChase’s involvement in the initiative has played a key role in attracting additional investors, says Rohan Kalbag, CEO of Main Street Launch. “JPMorganChase is an absolutely critical supporter of our work—playing a leadership role not just in terms of financing but also in the community,” he says.

With a new low-interest loan from the DVLF and a grant from the city, Annie and Gonzalo were able to buy equipment and finance the new business. In March 2025, Chalos Express opened in a 200-square-foot space downtown, less than a block from JPMorganChase’s Mission Street headquarters.

Today, Annie says, foot traffic downtown is increasing, and more businesses are opening up. “San Francisco has been going through rough times,” she says. “It’s trending in the right direction. My husband always says we’re stubborn. We want to survive. The city will recover, and we want to be part of it.”

The business community steps up

JPMorganChase firmly believes in San Francisco’s future, and in the part we can play in it. We’re deepening our century-old roots in the city by renovating our offices at 560 Mission and One Front Street. Now underway, this project will trigger additional economic activity, in addition to the $1.2 billion we contribute annually to the local economy.

As a longstanding corporate citizen of San Francisco, we’re committed to helping its small businesses grow. We’re determined to help restore the vibrancy of Downtown—to help create the conditions in which those small businesses can thrive. We’re bringing together our fellow members of the business community in volunteer efforts to beautify Downtown’s streets.

Through the Downtown Volunteer Coalition (DVC), founded in May 2024 as a joint initiative with Hands On Bay Area (HOBA) and four other local companies, JPMorganChase has helped to directly mobilize fellow members of the city’s business community. Volunteers paint murals, pick up trash, and help to restore parks. By year’s end, the coalition will double in size to include a total of ten companies. “It’s contagious,” says Lou Reda, Executive Director of HOBA, which works with for-profit and nonprofit organizations to create high-impact custom volunteering events. “When people start making a difference, others want to get involved.”

The DVC’s four events to date have mobilized 700 volunteers from downtown businesses in four industries—clothing manufacturing, finance, climate tech, and media—in high-impact activities to beautify the neighborhood and boost morale. “This is a way for volunteers to get reconnected to the city, and bring joy back to it, and bring their pride back to being a part of that ecosystem,” says Elinore Robey, HOBA's Corporate Account Specialist.

“I think that it sends an important signal to the city, to city leadership, and to the broader business community that JPMorganChase is committed to San Francisco,” says Tolentino. As we pursue both ongoing and new investments, including the renovation of our offices, we are readying ourselves for our next 120 years in the city.

Local restaurants and stores, with their specialty dishes, helped form her culinary tastes. But Erin’s biggest influence was her mother’s Creole-influenced cuisine. “I always believed my mom was the best cook in the world,” she says. “And I believed in feeding people with love. My mom fed the church her gumbo, her cornbread dressing. Everybody came over to pick up a plate at Thanksgiving.”

As an adult, seeking to give back to her neighborhood, Erin became a social worker. But food remained her true passion: “Feeding people is a love of helping people too,” she says. After attending culinary school, she founded her own small catering business, WeFeastSF. She became an increasingly visible member of the local small-business community. She networked tirelessly.

That’s how Stacy Dickinson, Business Banking Area Manager and Executive Director of JPMorganChase’s San Jose office, first encountered her—at a local networking event, where Erin’s energy and fearlessness, and her pride in her product, made a strong impression. “She comes out with her basket of jambalaya mix,” Stacy recalls, “and she is literally selling it to every person at this event.” It was clear, she says, that Erin “didn't want to just cater. She didn't want to just sell at a farmer's market. Her goal was for a mass audience to enjoy her food.”

Stacy grew up in the Bay Area herself, and it’s her passion to find and develop local entrepreneurs. Small businesses, which employ about 360,000 workers in the city, play a vital, sustaining role in the economy of San Francisco. They also play a crucial role as both community and commercial hubs, and bolster the city’s cultural districts.

Over the course of the following months, Stacy kept in touch with Erin and offered advice. When Chase and the Golden State Warriors launched the Alley-Oop Accelerator, a small- business training and mentorship program, she immediately recruited Erin. The Accelerator brings together entrepreneurs from underserved local communities to learn how to grow their businesses. “When I told her about it, she got quiet,” Stacy recalls. “Then she said, ‘I’m in. What do I do?’”

For seven weeks, Erin attended workshops both in person and over Zoom—about accessing capital, managing cash flow, marketing online and in person, pricing, and hiring. About fraud and cybersecurity and merchant services. Participants pitched their products every day to each other, to local business owners, and to workshop leaders. The objective was to implement what they were learning into their businesses immediately, in real time.

“We worked on the things we were lacking in,” says Erin, who describes classes on financial literacy, taxes, sales projections, and using social media, among others. “They taught us how to redirect what’s working and what isn’t, and how to create more revenue through what is working. They helped us connect with people at Chase Bank” for additional guidance and prospective funding. “And we uplifted each other as a whole cohort.” The program enabled her to focus her business plan for the first time. “It made me rethink my demographics,” she says. “It made me find my lane—because I was in every lane.”

When the Accelerator’s participants were told that executives from the Warriors would join them on the last day of workshops, Erin decided to bring in a batch of her peach-cobbler nachos. This recipe is a twist on the pie her mother used to make (after extensive experimentation, Erin discovered that deconstructing the recipe helped maintain the crispness of the crust). “Everybody tried my nachos,” she recalls. “They were tearing it up, even people that didn’t like desserts. It was overwhelming.” She boldly announced that her goal was to serve the nachos at the team’s home court, the Chase Center.

She was in luck. Erin applied for and was accepted into the arena’s F&B program, which features small businesses in the area; this allowed her to showcase her peach-cobbler and apple-pie nachos throughout the Warriors and Valkyries seasons.

“I think the program allowed her to continue to build her confidence,” Stacy says. “Now she goes for everything. And if they tell her no, she asks again.” With 270,000 small business clients in the Bay Area, JPMorganChase is committed to supporting local business owners and entrepreneurs at every stage of their journey. Stacy speaks with the program’s alumni regularly; she joins them at milestone events for their businesses. And the participants themselves stay in touch via social media. The Alley-Oop Accelerator’s next cohort will run in tandem with the Golden State Valkyries season. Going forward, Stacy says, the intention is to host the program at least twice a year. “It’s so important for these business owners to take a chance on themselves,” Stacy says. “And this program creates the opportunity for people to do that.”

Erin is currently working to introduce her products into cafeterias at San Francisco public schools. She’s also pursuing the possibility of serving her nachos at Oracle Park, where the San Francisco Giants play.

The small businesses of her childhood helped shape Erin’s culinary ambitions and curiosity. Her goal now is to offer her products to the biggest possible audience. “I want to be worldwide,” she says, “in all the stadiums.”

She hoped to stay close to her family; she has lived in the San Francisco area all her life. But finding an apartment that met these criteria was incredibly challenging.

San Francisco today is one of the most expensive cities in the world to build in, and its complex regulatory environment can present challenges for new development. At the same time, the wealth gap has continued to widen, leaving behind families, forcing workers into long commutes, and putting vulnerable communities at risk. In 2023, 40% of San Francisco renters were considered cost burdened, and the median price of a Bay Area home, as of August 2025, was $959,000.

But even under the best of circumstances, people with disabilities encounter significant obstacles when they seek affordable housing. They’re often on a fixed income; they struggle to find a home designed to meet their specific needs; and they face both discrimination and a lack of options.

Since 2019, JPMorganChase has helped develop and finance over 25,000 affordable rental homes in the San Francisco Bay Area. We’re working with local organizations, civic leaders, and thoughtful developers to make living in San Francisco affordable and accessible.

The Kelsey Civic Center

Located in the heart of downtown, directly across the street from City Hall, The Kelsey Civic Center was codeveloped by Mercy Housing California and The Kelsey, a not-for-profit co-founded by Micaela Connery and her cousin, Kelsey Flynn O’Connor. Born with multiple significant disabilities, Kelsey insisted on living independently, in her own apartment, and that’s the experience The Kelsey Civic Center is designed to provide to others.

As it happens, JPMorganChase wasn’t the project’s original lender, but mobilized to deliver financing in record time, during a period of industry-wide uncertainty. Connery calls JPMorganChase “a save-the-day supporter.” “We just want to be there for our clients, if our clients need us,” says James Vossoughi, Executive Director, JPMorganChase Community Development Banking. The firm has provided $51 million in construction financing and $1.2 million in permanent financing to help bring The Kelsey Civic Center to life.

Fiona Ruddy, Senior Project Manager at Mercy Housing California, the project’s codeveloper, recalls discussions with JPMorganChase’s team even before a new lender was chosen. “They were trying to get us to the best financing path in a way that really had nothing to dowith their own interest, but was in the benefit of the project. That really demonstrated to us JPMorganChase’s commitment to the affordable-housing-development community.”

Some 7,000 people applied to live in The Kelsey Civic Center, including Odjahnae, via San Francisco’s affordable-housing lottery system. The mixed-income, mixed-ability building, which opened its doors in April 2025, comprises 112 homes for individuals and families making between 20% and 80% of Area Median Income, with 25% of them reserved for people with disabilities who use Home and Community Based Services.

“That's the great thing about it: Residents of The Kelsey live in a community that is just like any other market-rate community,” says Vossoughi. “They get the opportunity to have a home and live independently, just like everyone else.”

All of the building’s floors feature colored wayfinding for people with low literacy or low vision. The extra-wide hallways can accommodate two wheelchairs going in opposite directions. Tactile paving and acoustic ceilings create what the building’s architects call sensory “maps.” Two full- time staffers—known as the Inclusion Concierge team—support residents in orienting themselves in the neighborhood and city, connecting to external programs like healthcare and nutrition, and navigating the complex services system.

When Odjahnae was accepted into The Kelsey Civic Center, she felt both delight and anxiety. What if she struggled meeting new people? “But mostly, I was excited to finally have the freedom to do whatever I want in my own space,” she says.

She likes to hang out on the rooftop of The Kelsey Civic Center and listen to music. She has befriended some of her neighbors at the building’s regular bingo and movie nights, including a mother and daughter with whom she goes on walks. Recently, she and another neighbor went to the mall—the first time in her life Odjahnae had ever gone out independently. This year, she’ll celebrate the holidays for the first time living in her own place. “I’m excited to get my own Christmas tree,” she says.

1064 Mission

The goal of 1064 Mission—San Francisco’s largest supportive housing development for formerly homeless individuals—wasn’t simply to provide housing, says Ruddy. It was “to create a community where people can heal, grow, and really build brighter futures.”

Codeveloped by Mercy Housing California and Episcopal Community Services (which also provides services to residents), the building’s calming, inviting rooms and communal spaces are built to specific therapeutic standards, a feature known as trauma-informed design, for its residents: people who are exiting chronic homelessness. Forty percent of the 256 units are set aside for people aged 55 and up.

1064 Mission was assembled according to a model that potentially allows for significant savings of time and expense, depending on project and location: Its modular housing units were built offsite in their entirety, transported to San Francisco, then craned into place. 1064 Mission was made possible by $76 million in construction financing and $53 million in Low Income Housing Tax Credit equity from JPMorganChase.

The building’s residents have “experienced significant barriers to stable housing and need to be supported in the right way,” says Cécile Chalifour, Head of the West Region, Community Development Banking at JPMorganChase. To that end, medical and social-support services are housed on the ground floor: the Maria X Martinez Health Resource Center, including the Department of Public Health’s specialized street medicine program and dental services, and offices for the Homeless Outreach Team of the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing. The ground floor also includes a commercial kitchen and training center for Episcopal Community Services’ workforce-development and social-enterprise program. “You cannot say it enough times,” says Chalifour. “Permanent Supportive Housing works, but with services. You take out the services, and you have a building full of people whose needs are not being met.”

In JPMorganChase’s efforts to create and preserve affordable housing for vulnerable populations, 1064 Mission was “the right mission project,” says Chalifour. “And that’s very much the culture of the bank: Doing what's right, and doing it the right way.”

JPMorganChase recognizes its business is only as strong as the communities it serves and has spent significant time with clients, customers, policymakers, and community leaders across Los Angeles to strategically deploy resources, including more than $9 million in philanthropic contributions, in support of wildfire recovery.

“As a proud Angeleno, I’ve seen firsthand the heartbreak and devastation these wildfires have caused,” said Diedra Porché, Regional Chair of the California and West Market Leadership Teams at JPMorganChase. “We all know someone who has lost a home, a favorite restaurant, or a cherished space in the community. JPMorganChase stands with Los Angeles, not only in times of disaster, but every day for the past 135 years as a dedicated partner in the region’s future. Our investments in wildfire recovery over the past year are a testament to our unwavering support to California and the people who call it home.”

Immediate disaster relief

When wildfires spread through Los Angeles in January 2025, JPMorganChase acted swiftly to help deliver immediate relief to those most affected. The Altadena Chase branch quickly reopened so that residents could access essential banking services, seek guidance, and find reassurance during uncertain times. At the Pacific Palisades branch, more than 660 safe deposit boxes were recovered and safely transferred to a new location for customers to claim their property. The firm also provided more than $2 million in emergency philanthropic contributions to the American Red Cross, California Community Foundation, and United Way of Greater Los Angeles – part of the over $275 million collectively raised by these organizations – which helped serve more than 160,000 people, distribute over 170,000 meals, provide financial aid to more than 30,000 households, and support hundreds of local nonprofits in urgent relief and long-term recovery.

Housing & home lending relief

Over the past year, JPMorganChase has provided meaningful home lending relief to homeowners in Altadena and Pacific Palisades, offering mortgage forbearance and loan modification options to impacted customers and assisting with insurance claims to help residents recover from significant wildfire-related damages. The firm’s philanthropic investments helped accelerate the construction and preservation of housing, including through a $3 million philanthropic contribution to Neighborhood Housing Services of Los Angeles County for financial counseling and affordable lending and $1 million to the California Community Foundation to help families secure interim housing and rebuild their homes.

Supporting small businesses

JPMorganChase supported small businesses impacted by the wildfires through loan relief, including deferred payments for those affected. The firm also delivered significant philanthropic support to help neighborhoods, small businesses, and families recover. Through $750,000 in philanthropic capital to Pacific Community Ventures and $500,000 to Inclusive Action for the City, the firm helped provide affordable capital, hands-on advising, and emergency resources to small businesses impacted by the wildfires, helping them reopen, rehire staff, and restore jobs.

Volunteerism

From January to November 2025, our employees contributed more than 4,000 volunteer hours in Los Angeles, supporting over 100 local organizations. The firm also matched employee donations dollar-for-dollar to select organizations, totaling $500,000.

Supporting long-term recovery solutions

A new Chase branch is expected to open in Pacific Palisades in Spring 2026 – replacing the previous location lost to the fire – with its ATM already fully operational since summer 2025. JPMorganChase also contributed $1 million to The Center by Lendistry to research and develop comprehensive financing strategies for wildfire recovery and redevelopment across Los Angeles County, and $130,000 to Pasadena Community Foundation’s Altadena Builds Back Foundation to support effective disaster response in Altadena.

Looking Ahead: Investing in Los Angeles’s future

As Los Angeles prepares for major sporting and cultural events in the coming years, JPMorganChase is deepening its support for economic growth for all, particularly in the Crenshaw district which will serve as a hub of economic activity. The firm is proud to support the Crenshaw Cultural District Collaborative and ongoing efforts to ensure that all Angelenos can benefit from the economic activity and opportunities ahead.

For more than 135 years, JPMorganChase has brought the best of our business to help power Los Angeles’s economy and serve its communities. Across LA, the firm serves more than 5 million consumer customers and has more than 565,000 small business clients and more than 6,000 employees. With over 335 branches in the region, the firm is deepening relationships and expanding its presence with 28 community branches, including the Crenshaw Community Center branch, where we host events, financial health workshops, skills training and small business pop-ups.

NEW YORK, N.Y., January 7, 2026 — According to new MetLife research, less than half of America’s workforce is holistically healthy as employees battle rising costs and employers balance investing in benefits with broader cost-cutting measures. These early findings from MetLife’s 2026 U.S. Employee Benefit Trends Study underscore the challenge of sustaining workforce well-being and engagement in an environment where both employees and employers are financially strained.

Key highlights include:

83% of employees say rising living expenses and medical costs are their top stressors and 77% say economic uncertainty is a major concern

On average, employees miss 6.1 days of work due to health-related issues and 50% of employees often avoid seeking medical care because of out-of-pocket costs

Employers cite “controlling health care costs” as the #1 benefits objective, surpassing productivity, loyalty, and attracting new talent for the first time since 2022

60% of employers increased their investment in benefits and 62% expanded their non-medical offerings

As overall workforce well-being has stalled, with just 44% of employees report feeling holistic healthy1 and engagement, loyalty and productivity remaining flat2

“Current economic conditions mean employers are under immense pressure to manage costs while remaining invested in employee well-being at a time when their workforce is also stressed,” said Todd Katz, Head of U.S. Group Benefits at MetLife. “Our research shows how effective benefits strategies can help organizations strike a balance between financial discipline and improving outcomes for their employees.”

Holistic Health and Non-Medical Benefits Drive Financial Gains

Employers recognize that investing in workforce health and well-being improves business outcomes. According to employers surveyed, for every $1 invested in employee health, employers would expect an average of $2.30 return through gains in productivity, retention, and lower medical spending. Holistically healthy employees also report being 25% more productive and loyal and taking 10% fewer sick days—driving a significant return on investment (ROI) for employers.

Non-medical benefits such as dental plans, financial wellness solutions, disability insurance and leave support are considered particularly impactful for lifting employee health while reducing costs—73% of employers say non-medical benefits are the most cost-effective way to support employee well-being and 83% report lower medical costs as a result of offering them.

Despite increased investments in benefits by employers, employee health and productivity have stalled. Employers need to strategically tailor benefit offerings to the specific needs of the workforce that provide meaningful support. Non-medical benefits such as legal services, accident and health insurance can play a critical role by supplementing medical plans and supporting employees across all ages and life stages.

How to Maximize ROI of Benefits Strategies

MetLife’s data emphasizes the impact that offering non-medical benefits can have on outcomes through significant uplifts in employee health—employees are 38% more likely to feel holistically healthy when using 5 or more non-medical benefits and 69% more likely when they use 10 or more.

Improving access to preventive care, which emphasizes early intervention and detection, can help employees reduce the risk of more serious and expensive health events in the future—84% of employees say preventive care reduces their chances of having more serious health problems and 80% say it saves them money as a result—62% also say non-medical benefits are essential to accessing preventive care, according to MetLife’s study.

""Through more strategic investments in employee health and benefits—beyond simply expanding the menu of options—organizations can help strengthen the resilience of their workforce in the face of persistent cost pressures,"" adds Katz. ""This ultimately empowers businesses to sustain growth, adapt to change and maintain a competitive edge in any environment.""",neutral

Younger workers – Gen Z and Millennials – are starting to save earlier, engaging more actively with their workplace retirement plans, and planning for market volatility, while many Gen X and Boomers report wishing they had taken similar steps sooner.

“Our research highlights how different generations approach retirement – and what we can learn from them,” said Cathy Marasco, head of Protected Retirement at Nationwide. “Younger savers are showing that early engagement and proactive planning can create confidence and resilience, while older generations offer valuable perspective on the risks of waiting to take action. As we think about resolving to create better financial habits in the year ahead, these insights give all of us a clearer roadmap for building a stronger financial future.”

Young savers are practicing smart retirement behaviors

On average, Gen Z and Millennial savers started contributing to their workplace retirement plans at age 23 and 28 respectively – nearly a decade earlier than Gen X (34) and Boomers (40). They’re also more engaged and protection focused: checking balances weekly, increasing contributions annually, and planning ahead for market volatility. Roughly 7 in 10 younger savers say they have a strategy to safeguard their savings before retirement, compared to just 55% of Gen X and 44% of Boomers.

Millennials, in particular, are leaning more on resources like their company’s HR team, retirement plan providers, and financial advisors to guide their decisions. And both Gen Z and Millennials show greater familiarity with investment solutions that provide downside protection – and are more likely to say they’d use them.

Ultimately, these habits are paying off. Eight in 10 younger savers feel optimistic about their retirement plans. Nearly half also feel confident about the savings they’ve accumulated – compared with just a third of Gen X and a quarter of Boomers.

Older savers share regrets

On the flip side, older savers were candid about what they wish they’d done differently. More than 80% of Gen X and Boomers regret not starting to save or participating in their employer-sponsored retirement plan earlier. Over 8 in 10 also wish they’d focused earlier on strategies to protect their savings from market volatility or convert assets into sustainable income in retirement. These regrets are compounded by persistent knowledge gaps, including:

Over three-quarters of older savers wish they understood the power of compounding interest and the benefits of maximizing contributions at a younger age

54% of Gen X and 39% of Boomers still misunderstand how compounding interest works

More than half believe their 401(k) will provide predictable monthly income like a paycheck, setting unrealistic retirement expectations

These missed opportunities have real consequences. One in five Gen X and Boomers feel they’re on the wrong track for retirement and almost 1 in 3 now expect to retire later than planned. And economic uncertainty is adding pressure, with many reporting increased anxiety about their retirement savings over the past year.

Starting early pays dividends

Analysis of NRI’s research by The American College of Financial Services highlights just how powerful an early start can be. Among those who began saving for retirement by age 25, three-quarters feel confident or cautiously optimistic about their future, compared to just 46% of those who started later – a 30-point gap. Even beyond that cutoff, the trend holds: optimistic savers began at roughly age 30 or younger, while those who feel anxious or pessimistic started around age 32 or older.

""The lesson is simple: don’t wait for the perfect moment or the perfect amount to start saving,"" said Eric Ludwig, PhD, CFP®, Director of the Center for Retirement Income at The American College. ""Building the habit early – even with modest contributions – sets the foundation for decades of confidence and better retirement readiness.""

Kick off 2026 with smarter saving

With the new year underway, it’s an ideal moment for retirement savers to take stock of where they stand and where they want to be. To start 2026 on the right path, consider some simple actions that can help improve your retirement outlook:

Start now – or increase what you’re already saving. Every day you wait is a missed opportunity for growth. If you’re already contributing, consider a small increase. Even a 1% bump can make a meaningful difference over time.

Contribute enough to earn your full employer match. Roughly 20% of savers across all generations say they either don’t contribute enough to receive the full match or aren’t sure if they do, leaving money on the table. If your budget allows, consider maximizing contributions to capture even more growth potential.

Check in with your retirement plan provider or financial advisor. A quick review at the start of the year can help you understand if your current allocation and risk level still align with your goals, and whether rebalancing may be appropriate.

Prepare for market changes and long-term income. Take time to understand how your current savings will eventually convert into income in retirement and explore plan options that provide protection or guaranteed income – features that can help stabilize your strategy through market shifts.

“A new year is a natural point to reset your financial habits,” said Marasco. “Workplace retirement plans are evolving to include many of the tools and protections needed to build long-term security – like income solutions, portfolio guidance and downside protection – making it easier for savers to take the next step.”

Advisors and plan sponsors can help ensure their participants have the tools they need to be confident and thrive in retirement. Learn about Nationwide’s Protected Retirement solutions or view the full survey findings.

Pediatric cIAI and cUTI Patients:The most common adverse reactions in pediatric patients with cIAI and cUTI (>3%) were vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and infusion site phlebitis.",2019-03-18 00:00:00,"pediatric, including, avycaz, treatment, clinical, patients, cuti, center, abbvie, ciai, metronidazole, infections","DUBLIN , March 18, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Allergan plc (NYSE: AGN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has approved the company's supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for AVYCAZ® (ceftazidime and avibactam), expanding the label to include pediatric patients 3 months and older for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) in combination with metronidazole and complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI). This is the first FDA approval of a pediatric indication for cUTI and cIAI in more than a decade.

""Difficult-to-treat gram-negative pathogens pose a significant health risk, particularly to the vulnerable and sensitive pediatric patient population with few options for treatment,"" said David Nicholson , Chief Research & Development Officer at Allergan . ""As resistance rises among the gram-negative pathogens that cause these serious infections, the expanded label for AVYCAZ provides a safe and effective treatment option now for pediatric patients with cIAI and cUTI. These expanded indications in pediatric patients with infections, including infants and those at a particularly young age, address an unmet need among this vulnerable population and underscore Allergan's efforts in anti-infective research.""

The label expansion was approved based on results from two active-controlled clinical studies evaluating AVYCAZ in children or infants with cIAI or cUTI, as well as a single-dose pharmacokinetic study. In the cIAI study, the safety and efficacy of AVYCAZ (in combination with metronidazole) was compared with meropenem. In the cUTI study, AVYCAZ was compared with cefepime.

Across the trials, 128 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 18 years of age were treated with AVYCAZ. Overall, the findings from the pediatric studies were similar to the previous determination of safety for AVYCAZ for the treatment of adult patients with cIAI or cUTI, and no new safety concerns were identified in pediatric patients.

The primary objectives of the studies were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AVYCAZ, and they were not powered for a statistical analysis of efficacy. The descriptive efficacy analyses in the pediatric studies were consistent with data from studies in adults with cIAI and cUTI. In the pediatric cIAI study, the clinical cure rate at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population was 91.8% (56/61) in the AVYCAZ plus metronidazole group and 95.5% (21/22) in the meropenem group. Clinical cure rates for the predominant pathogens, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were 90.5% and 85.7%, respectively for patients treated with AVYCAZ plus metronidazole, and 92.3% and 88.9%, respectively, for patients treated with meropenem. In the pediatric cUTI study, the combined favorable clinical and microbiological response rate at TOC in the microbiological-ITT population was 72.2% (39/54) in the AVYCAZ group and 60.9% (14/23) in the cefepime group. The microbiologic response rate for E.coli, the most common uropathogen identified in the study, was 79.6% for patients treated with AVYCAZ and 59.1% for patients treated with cefepime.

AVYCAZ was first approved by the FDA in February 2015 for the treatment of cUTI including pyelonephritis, and cIAI in combination with metronidazole, caused by designated susceptible bacteria including certain Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, for patients 18 years of age and older. AVYCAZ was subsequently approved for the treatment of adults with hospital-acquired pneumonia / ventilator-associated pneumonia (HABP/VABP) caused by designated susceptible bacteria in February 2018.

About AVYCAZ® (ceftazidime and avibactam)

AVYCAZ is a fixed-dose combination antibacterial indicated for the treatment of cIAI (in combination with metronidazole), and cUTI caused by designated susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms in patients 3 months or older. AVYCAZ is also indicated for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) in adults. AVYCAZ consists of a combination of avibactam and ceftazidime.

Avibactam is a first-in-class non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor which protects ceftazidime against degradation by certain beta-lactamases. Avibactam does not decrease the activity of ceftazidime against ceftazidime-susceptible organisms. Ceftazadime is a third-generation cephalosporin with a well-established efficacy and safety profile.

AVYCAZ has demonstrated in vitro activity against Enterobacteriaceae in the presence of some beta-lactamases and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) of the following groups: TEM, SHV, CTX-M, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPCs), AmpC and certain oxacillinases (OXA). AVYCAZ also demonstrated in vitro activity against P. aeruginosa in the presence of some AmpC beta-lactamases, and certain strains lacking outer membrane porin (OprD). AVYCAZ is not active against bacteria that produce metallo-beta lactamases and may not have activity against Gram-negative bacteria that overexpress efflux pumps or have porin mutations.

Ceftazidime and avibactam is being jointly developed with Pfizer. Allergan holds the rights to commercialize ceftazidime and avibactam in North America under the brand name AVYCAZ, while Pfizer holds the rights to commercialize the combination in the rest of the world under the brand name ZAVICEFTA®.""

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections (cIAI)

AVYCAZ (ceftazidime and avibactam), in combination with metronidazole, is indicated for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) in adult and pediatric patients 3 months or older caused by the following susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter freundii complex, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTI), including Pyelonephritis

AVYCAZ is indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) including pyelonephritis in adult and pediatric patients 3 months or older caused by the following susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii complex, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Hospital-acquired Bacterial Pneumonia and Ventilator-associated Bacterial Pneumonia (HABP/VABP)

AVYCAZ is indicated for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) in patients 18 years or older caused by the following susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae.

Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of AVYCAZ and other antibacterial drugs, AVYCAZ should be used to treat only indicated infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

CONTRAINDICATIONS

AVYCAZ is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to the components of AVYCAZ (ceftazidime and avibactam), avibactam-containing products, or other members of the cephalosporin class.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

In a Phase 3 cIAI trial in adult patients, clinical cure rates were lower in a subgroup of patients with baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30 to less than or equal to 50 mL/min compared to those with CrCl greater than 50 mL/min. The reduction in clinical cure rates was more marked in patients treated with AVYCAZ plus metronidazole compared to meropenem-treated patients. Within this subgroup, patients treated with AVYCAZ received a 33% lower daily dose than is currently recommended for patients with CrCl of 30 to less than or equal to 50 mL/min. Clinical cure rate in patients with normal renal function/mild renal impairment (CrCl greater than 50 mL/min) was 85% (322/379) with AVYCAZ plus metronidazole vs 86% (321/373) with meropenem, and clinical cure rate in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to less than or equal to 50 mL/min) was 45% (14/31) with AVYCAZ plus metronidazole vs 74% (26/35) with meropenem. The decreased clinical response was not observed for patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline (CrCl 30 to less than or equal to 50 mL/min) in the Phase 3 cUTI trials or the Phase 3 HABP/VABP trial. Monitor CrCl at least daily in adult and pediatric patients with changing renal function and adjust the dosage of AVYCAZ accordingly.

Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions and serious skin reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterial drugs. Before therapy with AVYCAZ is instituted, careful inquiry about previous hypersensitivity reactions to other cephalosporins, penicillins, or carbapenems should be made. Exercise caution if this product is to be given to a penicillin or other beta-lactam-allergic patient because cross sensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial drugs has been established. Discontinue the drug if an allergic reaction to AVYCAZ occurs.

Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial drugs, including AVYCAZ, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial drugs. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, antibacterials not directed against C. difficile should be discontinued, if possible.

Seizures, nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, neuromuscular excitability, and myoclonia have been reported in patients treated with ceftazidime, particularly in the setting of renal impairment. Adjust dosing based on CrCl.

Prescribing AVYCAZ in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adult cIAI, cUTI and HABP/VABP Patients:

The most common adverse reactions in adult patients with cIAI (? 5% when used with metronidazole) were diarrhea (8%), nausea (7%), and vomiting (5%). The most common adverse reactions in adult patients with cUTI (3%) were diarrhea and nausea. The most common adverse reactions in adult patients with HABP/VABP (? 5%) were diarrhea (15%) and vomiting (6%).

Pediatric cIAI and cUTI Patients:

The most common adverse reactions in pediatric patients with cIAI and cUTI (>3%) were vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and infusion site phlebitis.

BOTOX® (onabotulinumtoxinA) Important Information [UPDATE WITH FINAL APPROVED ISI]

Indications

BOTOX® is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used:

to treat increased muscle stiffness in children 2 to 17 years of age with upper limb spasticity

to treat increased muscle stiffness in children 2 to 17 years of age with lower limb spasticity, excluding spasticity caused by cerebral palsy

to treat certain types of eye muscle problems (strabismus) or abnormal spasm of the eyelids (blepharospasm) in people 12 years and older

It is not known whether BOTOX® is safe or effective for other types of muscle spasms.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

BOTOX® may cause serious side effects that can be life threatening. Get medical help right away if you have any of these problems any time (hours to weeks) after injection of BOTOX®:

Problems swallowing, speaking, or breathing, due to weakening of associated muscles, can be severe and result in loss of life. You are at the highest risk if these problems are pre-existing before injection. Swallowing problems may last for several months.

due to weakening of associated muscles, can be severe and result in loss of life. You are at the highest risk if these problems are pre-existing before injection. Swallowing problems may last for several months. Spread of toxin effects. The effect of botulinum toxin may affect areas away from the injection site and cause serious symptoms including: loss of strength and all-over muscle weakness, double vision, blurred vision and drooping eyelids, hoarseness or change or loss of voice, trouble saying words clearly, loss of bladder control, trouble breathing, and trouble swallowing.

There has not been a confirmed serious case of spread of toxin effect away from the injection site when BOTOX® has been used at the recommended dose to treat blepharospasm or strabismus.

BOTOX® may cause loss of strength or general muscle weakness, vision problems, or dizziness within hours to weeks of taking BOTOX®. If this happens, do not drive a car, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities.

Do not receive BOTOX® if you: are allergic to any of the ingredients in BOTOX® (see Medication Guide for ingredients); had an allergic reaction to any other botulinum toxin product such as Myobloc® (rimabotulinumtoxinB), Dysport® (abobotulinumtoxinA), or Xeomin® (incobotulinumtoxinA); have a skin infection at the planned injection site.

The dose of BOTOX® is not the same as, or comparable to, another botulinum toxin product.

Serious and/or immediate allergic reactions have been reported including itching, rash, red itchy welts, wheezing, asthma symptoms, or dizziness or feeling faint. Get medical help right away if you experience symptoms; further injection of BOTOX® should be discontinued.

Tell your doctor about all your muscle or nerve conditions such as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, myasthenia gravis, or Lambert-Eaton syndrome, as you may be at increased risk of serious side effects including difficulty swallowing and difficulty breathing from typical doses of BOTOX®.

Cornea problems have been reported. Cornea (surface of the eye) problems have been reported in some people receiving BOTOX® for their blepharospasm, especially in people with certain nerve disorders. BOTOX® may cause the eyelids to blink less, which could lead to the surface of the eye being exposed to air more than is usual. Tell your doctor if you experience any problems with your eyes while receiving BOTOX®. Your doctor may treat your eyes with drops, ointments, contact lenses, or with an eye patch.

Bleeding behind the eye has been reported. Bleeding behind the eyeball has been reported in some people receiving BOTOX® for their strabismus. Tell your doctor if you notice any new visual problems while receiving BOTOX®.

Upper respiratory tract infections (common colds) have been reported. In pediatric patients treated with BOTOX® for upper limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infections were reported more frequently. In pediatric patients treated with BOTOX® for lower limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infection was not reported with an incidence greater than placebo.

Tell your doctor about all your medical conditions, including if you: have or have had bleeding problems; have plans to have surgery; had surgery on your face; weakness of forehead muscles; trouble raising your eyebrows; drooping eyelids; any other abnormal facial change; are pregnant or plan to become pregnant (it is not known if BOTOX® can harm your unborn baby); are breastfeeding or plan to (it is not known if BOTOX® passes into breast milk).

Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Using BOTOX® with certain other medicines may cause serious side effects. Do not start any new medicines until you have told your doctor that you have received BOTOX® in the past.

Tell your doctor if you received any other botulinum toxin product in the last 4 months; have received injections of botulinum toxin such as Myobloc®, Dysport®, or Xeomin® in the past (tell your doctor exactly which product you received); have recently received an antibiotic by injection; take muscle relaxants; take an allergy or cold medicine; take a sleep medicine; take aspirin-like products or blood thinners.

Other side effects of BOTOX® include: dry mouth, discomfort or pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, neck pain, eye problems: double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight, drooping eyelids, swelling of your eyelids, dry eyes, drooping eyebrows; and upper respiratory tract infection.

For more information refer to the Medication Guide or talk with your doctor.

You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA . Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800- FDA -1088.

- Trial designed to evaluate veliparib as first-line therapy when added to DNA-damaging chemotherapy

- Third Phase III trial initiated by AbbVie evaluating veliparib in difficult-to-treat tumor types

NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., June 26, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced the initiation of a Phase III clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of its investigational compound, veliparib (ABT-888), when added to carboplatin and paclitaxel, two chemotherapeutic medicines, in patients with advanced breast cancer. Specifically, the combination of veliparib, carboplatin and paclitaxel will be compared to treatment with carboplatin, paclitaxel and placebo in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-(HER2) negative metastatic or locally-advanced breast cancer, containing BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 gene mutations.

""Our Phase III program for veliparib represents an innovative approach to developing this type of anti-cancer compound. By adding veliparib to DNA-damaging therapies, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, we can evaluate its potential to provide incremental benefit to existing treatments,"" said Michael Severino, M.D., executive vice president, Research and Development and chief scientific officer, AbbVie. ""This is the third Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of veliparib, and the second evaluating the addition of veliparib to chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with difficult-to-treat forms of breast cancer.""

The randomized, double-blind, Phase III clinical trial will recruit approximately 270 patients. The primary efficacy outcome of the trial is progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary pre-specified outcome measures include overall survival (OS), clinical benefit rate (CBR), objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR).

More information on the trial is available at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02163694).

About Veliparib (ABT-888)

Veliparib is an investigational oral poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]–ribose) polymerases (PARP) inhibitor being evaluated in multiple tumor types. PARP is a naturally-occurring enzyme in the body that repairs damage to DNA, and in certain types of cancers, repairs cancer cells. Discovered and developed by AbbVie researchers, veliparib is being developed to help prevent DNA repair in cancer cells and increase the effectiveness of common DNA-damaging therapies like chemotherapy or radiation. Veliparib is currently being studied in more than a dozen cancers and tumor types, including Phase III studies in non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer.

About HER2 Breast Cancer

Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in the world and the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide.1 The HER2 gene, which normally helps cells in the breast remain healthy and function normally, can play a role in the development of breast cancer. Specifically, in approximately 25 percent of breast cancers, the HER2 gene does not work properly, causing cells in the breast to grow and divide in an uncontrolled way. This process, known as HER2 gene amplification or overexpression, results in HER2-positive breast cancer. HER2-positive breast cancers tend to grow faster, metastasize more quickly and are more likely to recur, compared to patients diagnosed with HER2-negative breast cancer.2

About BRCA1 and BRCA2 Gene Mutation

It is estimated that at least five percent of breast cancer cases result from inherited mutations or alterations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancer susceptibility genes.3,4 Women with these mutations have a 40- to 85-percent lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Additionally, men with BRCA2 mutations carry an increased risk of breast cancer.5

-- Submission based on the largest Phase III program in genotype 1 (GT1) hepatitis C patients conducted to date[1]

-- European Medicines Agency has granted AbbVie's request for accelerated assessment

NORTH CHICAGO, Illinois, May 8, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) submitted marketing authorization applications (MAAs) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeking approval for the company's investigational, all-oral, interferon-free regimen for the treatment of adult patients with chronic genotype 1 (GT1) hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The MAAs are supported by data from the largest all-oral, interferon-free clinical program in GT1 patients conducted to date[1], which consists of six Phase III studies that include more than 2,300 patients in over 25 countries.

""These regulatory submissions bring us closer to offering adult genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C patients an all-oral, interferon-free regimen which has the potential to provide a promising advancement for the hepatitis C community in the European Union,"" said Scott Brun, M.D., vice president, Pharmaceutical Development, AbbVie. ""This regulatory milestone, on the heels of our submission of a New Drug Application in the U.S., represents an important step for our pipeline.""

Accelerated Assessment Granted

The EMA has granted AbbVie's request for accelerated assessment for ABT-450/ritonavir, ombitasvir (ABT-267), and dasabuvir (ABT-333), a designation that is granted to new medicines of major public health interest. Review of AbbVie's MAAs will be conducted under the centralized licensing procedure which, when finalized, provides one marketing authorization in all 28 member states of the European Union (EU). Although accelerated assessment could shorten the EMA's review time by approximately two months, it does not guarantee a positive opinion from the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) or final approval by the European Commission. If approved, ABT-450/ritonavir, ombitasvir (ABT-267), and dasabuvir (ABT-333) could be available for marketing in the EU in the first quarter of 2015.

Globally, approximately 160 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C[2] and an estimated 3 million to 4 million people are newly infected each year.[3] In Europe, approximately 17.5 million people have chronic hepatitis C,[4] with GT1 as the predominant genotype.[4]

About AbbVie's Investigational HCV Regimen

The AbbVie investigational regimen consists of the fixed-dose combination of ABT-450/ritonavir (150/100mg) co-formulated with ombitasvir (ABT-267) 25mg, dosed once daily, and dasabuvir (ABT-333) 250mg with or without ribavirin (weight-based), dosed twice daily. The combination of three different mechanisms of action interrupts the hepatitis C virus replication process with the goal of optimizing sustained virologic response rates across different patient populations.

Additional information about AbbVie's Phase III studies can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov.

AbbVie's HCV Development Program

The AbbVie HCV clinical development program is intended to advance scientific knowledge and clinical care by investigating an interferon-free, all-oral regimen with and without ribavirin with the goal of producing high sustained virologic response rates in as many patients as possible, including those that typically do not respond well to treatment, such as previous non-responders to interferon-based therapy or patients with advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis.

ABT-450 was discovered during the ongoing collaboration between AbbVie and Enanta Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ENTA) for hepatitis C virus protease inhibitors and regimens that include protease inhibitors. ABT-450 is being developed by AbbVie for use in combination with AbbVie's other investigational medicines for the treatment of hepatitis C.

His lab at the Salk Institute continues to lead the field in understanding how chemical additions to proteins control the cell cycle and growth, leading to new potential therapeutic targets for cancers.

An independent committee of world-renowned scientists selected Dr. Hunter for this recognition. He joins 25 other scientists who have received the Dr. Paul Janssen Award since 2004, including ten who have gone on to win the Nobel Prize.

“Dr. Hunter’s work stood out to the selection committee for its foundational impact in addressing one of the most pressing medical questions of our generation: Why do cancers thrive, and how do we stop them from growing? His discoveries have already made a great impact, and they continue to pave the way for new innovations in cancer therapies, improving outcomes for patients worldwide,” said Elaine Fuchs, Ph.D., Selection Committee Chair for the Dr. Paul Janssen Award. “As in every year, we had an impressive slate of researchers nominated for their exceptional work in the field of biomedical research.”

Johnson & Johnson will honor Dr. Hunter during a virtual symposium, cohosted with The New York Academy of Sciences on March 2, 2026. The symposium is free to anyone interested in celebrating scientific innovation. (Registration is required.)

“I am delighted to receive the Dr. Paul Janssen Award for Biomedical Research,” Hunter said. “I discovered tyrosine phosphorylation as a cancer mechanism while carrying out studies with a simple chicken tumor virus, hoping our findings would give us clues as to how human cancer develops. This serendipitous discovery led to a whole new class of cancer drugs and underscores the importance of funding for basic biomedical research, which can lead to other breakthrough cancer treatments.”

The Dr. Paul Janssen Award builds on Dr. Hunter’s extensive list of international scientific awards and recognitions, including the AACR Lifetime Achievement Award in Cancer Research, the Tang Prize in Biopharmaceutical Science and the Sjöberg Prize, among others.

Leveraging data from the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study, the company has applied for marketing authorization in multiple procedures in general surgery within the upper abdomen.

“We have taken learnings from Johnson & Johnson’s 140 years in surgery, our decades of leadership in minimally invasive surgery, and the experiences robotic surgeons and hospitals have had over the past 20 years to design a soft tissue robotic system built for the future of surgery,” said Hani Abouhalka, Company Group Chair, Surgery, MedTech, Johnson & Johnson. “I am proud of the design decisions and major scientific efforts that have gone into the system to support surgeons and successfully complete our first clinical trial, and I look forward to reaching the next milestone on our path to commercialization.”

Data from first clinical trial supporting submission

First cases in the OTTAVA IDE study were completed in early 2025 at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center by Dr. Erik Wilson*, Chief of Minimally Invasive and Elective General Surgery UT Health Houston and the lead investigator for the clinical study.

OTTAVA’s unique unified architecture, surgical instrumentation powered by Ethicon expertise, and future connection to the Polyphonic™ digital ecosystem are designed to address the unmet needs of surgeons and their teams. The Company filed data from the completed clinical trial with the aim of showcasing safety and effectiveness and supporting the system’s ability to perform a variety of procedures. Given OTTAVA’s novel architecture and differentiated technological capabilities, the company filed a De Novo classification request and is targeting an indication covering multiple procedures in general surgery within the upper abdomen, such as gastric bypass, gastric sleeve, small bowel resection and hiatal hernia repair.

“The IDE study builds on a significant body of preclinical evidence we have generated demonstrating the impact of the OTTAVA system and provides critical clinical evidence on the system performance,” said Peter Schulam, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer, MedTech, Johnson & Johnson. “Surgeon investigators across several hospitals led this important study to further clinical evidence in support of minimally invasive, robotic-assisted surgery for the benefit of clinical teams, hospitals, and patients.”

Second clinical trial approved in hernia repair

OTTAVA is designed as a multi-specialty soft-tissue surgery robot, supporting a broad range of procedures across patient anatomy and surgical specialties, including the most complex surgeries that require a multi-quadrant approach. In late 2025, Johnson & Johnson received IDE approval to begin a U.S. clinical trial for OTTAVA in inguinal hernia procedures, one of the most common surgeries in the U.S.1

The OTTAVA robotic system is under development and is not authorized to be marketed or sold in any market. For more information, visit: http://thenext.jnjmedtech.com/surgical-robotics.

The combination of teclistamab and daratumumab SC work in a complementary manner by targeting both BCMA and CD38 to prime and activate the immune system, supporting the potential to improve patient outcomes by enhancing immune-mediated response earlier in the treatment journey.1

“There remains a critical need for off-the-shelf treatment options that can achieve deep and durable responses at second line, when immune function is better preserved,” said Ester in ’t Groen, EMEA Therapeutic Area Head, Haematology, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. “Teclistamab and daratumumab SC is the first off-the-shelf immunotherapy combination to demonstrate significant improvements in progression-free and overall survival in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma as early as second line treatment, compared to current standards of care.”

The submission is supported by data from the Phase 3 MajesTEC-3 study. The study enrolled 587 patients across two treatment arms: teclistamab and daratumumab SC versus daratumumab SC and dexamethasone with either pomalidomide or bortezomib (DPd/DVd).1 Results show an 83.4 percent reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared to standard regimens at nearly three years follow-up (hazard ratio [HR], 0.17; 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.23; P<0.0001).1,2 More than 90 percent of patients who remained progression-free at six months (n=249) remained progression-free at three years.1 In the study, teclistamab plus daratumumab SC and standard of care comparators had similar rates of Grade 3/4 (95.1 percent vs. 96.6 percent) treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE)1 Most common Grade 3/4 events were cytopenia and infection.1 Infections were observed with teclistamab and daratumumab SC (any grade, 96.5 percent; Grade 3/4, 54.1 percent) and DPd/DVd comparator (any grade, 84.1 percent; Grade 3/4, 43.4 percent).1

Based on the statistical significance of the results, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) recommended unblinding of the study.3 Data from the MajesTEC-3 study were recently presented as a late-breaking oral presentation at the 2025 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting, with simultaneous publication in The New England Journal of Medicine.1,2 Johnson & Johnson has submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for the use of teclistamab and daratumumab SC in combination as a treatment for RRMM to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the combination regimen, which allows for expediting the development and regulatory review of a medicine that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and is based on preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement over available therapies on a clinically significant endpoint(s).

“Johnson & Johnson is committed to redefining what’s possible in multiple myeloma. An integral part of this strategy involves using the right medicines as early as possible and combining and sequencing them to achieve the best outcomes,” said Jordan Schecter, M.D., Vice President, Disease Area Leader, Multiple Myeloma, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. “Today’s submission to the EMA reinforces this approach. Daratumumab has become a cornerstone of care for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, and by combining it with teclistamab, we see the potential to advance outcomes for relapsed patients as early as second line.”

About the MajesTEC-3 Study

MajesTEC-3 (NCT05083169) is an ongoing, Phase 3 randomised study evaluating the safety and efficacy of teclistamab plus daratumumab subcutaneous (SC) (n=291) versus investigator’s choice of daratumumab subcutaneous (SC) and dexamethasone with either pomalidomide or bortezomib (n=296) (DPd/DVd) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who have received 1–3 prior lines of therapy.1,4 The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) and secondary endpoints include complete response or better (≥CR), overall response rate (ORR), minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity (10⁻⁵ by next-generation sequencing), overall survival (OS), time to worsening of symptoms (MySIm-Q), and safety.4 The MajesTEC-3 study is a part of the MajesTEC clinical programme, which includes exploring the potential of teclistamab as a combination regimen.4

About Teclistamab

Teclistamab received European Commission (EC) approval in August 2022 for the treatment of patients with RRMM who have received at least three prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody, and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy.5 In August 2023, the EC approved a Type II variation application for teclistamab, providing the option for a reduced dosing frequency of 1.5mg/kg every two weeks in patients who have achieved a complete response (CR) or better for a minimum of six months.6

Teclistamab is an off-the-shelf (or ready-to-use) bispecific antibody.7,8 Teclistamab, a subcutaneous injection, redirects T-cells through two cellular targets (BCMA and CD3) to activate the body’s immune system to fight cancer. Teclistamab is currently being evaluated in several combination studies.4,7,9,10,11

For a full list of adverse events and information on dosage and administration, contraindications and other precautions when using teclistamab, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics.▼ In line with EMA regulations for new medicines and those given conditional approval, teclistamab is subject to additional monitoring.7

About Daratumumab and Daratumumab SC

Johnson & Johnson is committed to exploring the potential of daratumumab for patients with multiple myeloma across the spectrum of the disease.

In August 2012, Janssen Biotech, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company, and Genmab A/S entered a worldwide agreement, which granted Johnson & Johnson an exclusive licence to develop, manufacture and commercialise daratumumab. Since launch, daratumumab has become a foundational therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma, having been used in the treatment of more than 618,000 patients worldwide.12 Daratumumab is the only CD38-directed antibody approved to be given subcutaneously to treat patients with multiple myeloma.13 Daratumumab SC is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology.13

CD38 is a surface protein that is present in high numbers on multiple myeloma cells, regardless of the stage of disease.13 Daratumumab binds to CD38 and inhibits tumour cell growth causing myeloma cell death.13 Daratumumab may also have an effect on normal cells.13 Data across ten Phase 3 clinical trials, in both the frontline and relapsed settings across all newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients,, have shown that daratumumab-based regimens resulted in significant improvement in progression-free survival and/or overall survival.14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23

About Multiple Myeloma

Multiple myeloma is currently an incurable blood cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called plasma cells, which are found in the bone marrow.24,25 In multiple myeloma, these malignant plasma cells continue to proliferate, accumulating in the body and crowding out normal blood cells, as well as often causing bone destruction and other serious complications.24,25 In the European Union, it is estimated that more than 35,000 people were diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2022, and more than 22,700 patients died.26 Patients living with multiple myeloma experience relapses which become more frequent with each line of therapy while remissions become progressively shorter.27,28,29 Whilst some patients with multiple myeloma initially have no symptoms, others can have common signs and symptoms of the disease, which can include bone fracture or pain, low red blood cell counts, fatigue, high calcium levels, infections, or kidney damage.30

The joint agreement meets the requests laid out by President Trump to the industry and provides the Company’s pharmaceutical products an exemption from tariffs1.

“Today’s agreement shows that when the public and private sectors work together towards shared goals, we can deliver real results for patients and the U.S. economy,” said Joaquin Duato, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Johnson & Johnson. “I’m proud that Johnson & Johnson is answering President Trump’s call to lower drug prices for everyday Americans while maintaining our role in improving and saving lives and ensuring that the United States continues to lead the world in healthcare innovation.”

Improving Access and Lowering Costs for U.S. Patients

Johnson & Johnson is working with the Trump Administration to improve access to medicines and lower costs for millions of American patients. The Company is:



Participating in TrumpRx.gov, a direct to patient platform, which will allow millions of American patients to purchase medicines from Johnson & Johnson at significantly discounted rates.

Enabling American patients to access medicines at comparable prices to other developed countries.

Providing Medicaid program access at comparable prices to other developed countries.

Continuing to support the Administration’s efforts to ensure better recognition of the value of health care across developed markets globally.

Delivering On Our $55B U.S. Investment

Johnson & Johnson also continues to deliver on our previously announced $55 billion investment to support U.S. manufacturing, research and development, and technology investments by early 2029. In just the last 10 months, the Company has initiated billions of dollars in investment in U.S. manufacturing, which will support the Company’s goal of manufacturing the vast majority of its advanced medicines in the U.S. to meet the needs of U.S. patients.

Today, as part of the $55 billion investment, the Company is announcing two new U.S. manufacturing facilities, including a next generation cell therapy manufacturing site in Pennsylvania and a state-of-the-art drug product manufacturing facility in North Carolina.

Additionally, construction is progressing on our $2 billion state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility in Wilson, North Carolina, which the Company broke ground on last year. That project will create approximately 5,000 skilled manufacturing and construction jobs in the state. Johnson & Johnson is already ramping up the hiring of advanced manufacturing employees to work at the facility.

In September, the Company also secured a new 160,000+ square foot dedicated biopharmaceutical manufacturing site in Holly Springs, North Carolina. The $2 billion commitment over the next 10 years will create approximately 120 new jobs in North Carolina.

Johnson & Johnson expects to announce additional U.S. investments later this year.

Update on the prevalence of diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) by major health insurance types in the US in 2016.
(2022) Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (Lupus).",2026-01-06 13:05:00,"sle, study, disease, identifier, including, unveils, systemic, showing, potential, reduce, lupus, accessed, available, johnson, clinicaltrialsgov, phase, nipocalimab","SPRING HOUSE, Pa., (January 6, 2026) – Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) today announced positive topline results from the Phase 2b JASMINE (NCT04882878) study of adults living with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the initiation of a Phase 3 program. The JASMINE study met the primary endpoint (percentage of patients achieving Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index [SRI-4]a composite response at Week 24 with statistical significance compared with placebo), and key secondary and exploratory endpoints, including those indicating the potential of nipocalimab for steroid sparing. Nipocalimab had a safety and tolerability profile consistent with previous Phase 2 studies, with no new safety signals identified.

These data represent the first positive results of an investigational FcRn blocker treatment in this chronic, debilitating autoantibody-driven disease that impacts an estimated 3 to 5 million people worldwide, and 450,000 in the U.S.1,2 Chronic symptoms of SLE include severe fatigue, joint pain and swelling, and rashes, including a hallmark butterfly-shaped facial rash.3

JASMINE is a 52-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging study of nipocalimab in 228 adult participants with active SLE and the first positive study of an FcRn blocker for the treatment of active SLE.4

“Systemic lupus erythematosus or SLE is a serious autoantibody-driven disease that can impact multiple organ systems, significantly reducing health-related quality of life for millions of people,” said Leonard L. Dragone, M.D., Ph.D., Disease Area Leader, Autoantibody and Rheumatology, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. “Many people living with SLE also face complications associated with long-term steroid use, underscoring the limitations of current treatment approaches and the critical need for immunoselective therapies that are safe, tolerable, and capable of reducing disease activity, while preserving immune function.”

Full results from the JASMINE study will be presented at a future medical congress.

Editor’s note:

a. The SLE Responder Index 4 (SRI-4) is a composite measure used to assess treatment response in patients with SLE during clinical studies. It comprises criteria from three different internationally validated indices, SELENA-SLE Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI), Physician Global Assessment (PGA) and the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) 2004.

ABOUT JASMINE

JASMINE (NCT04882878) is a 52-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging study of nipocalimab in 228 adult participants with active SLE and the first positive study of an FcRn blocker for the treatment of active SLE.4

ABOUT SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that occurs when the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks its own healthy tissues. This can lead to inflammation and damage in many parts of the body, including the skin, joints, heart, lungs, kidneys, and brain. SLE affects nine times more women than men, often striking initially between the ages of 15-44.5,7 In addition to systemic organ damage, other complications of SLE can include end-stage renal failure, scarring cutaneous lesions, neurological damage, and various forms of cardiovascular disease.5 People living with SLE often face reduced health-related quality of life, due to severe fatigue, mood disturbances, joint pain and swelling, and rashes, including the hallmark butterfly-shaped facial rash, as well as complications of long-term glucocorticoid use.3 Severe fatigue is the most widely reported and debilitating symptom of SLE, affecting up to 80% of people with SLE. SLE is the most common form of lupus, affecting 3 to 5 million people worldwide, approximately 70% of lupus cases.1,7 It is estimated that 450,000 people in the United States are affected by SLE.2

ABOUT NIPOCALIMAB

Nipocalimab is an investigational monoclonal antibody, designed to bind with high affinity to block FcRn and reduce levels of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies potentially without additional detectable effects on other adaptive and innate immune functions. This includes autoantibodies and alloantibodies that underlie multiple conditions across three key segments in the autoantibody space including Rare Autoantibody diseases, Maternal Fetal diseases mediated by maternal alloantibodies and autoantibody-driven Rheumatic diseases.8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 Blockade of IgG binding to FcRn in the placenta is also believed to limit transplacental transfer of maternal alloantibodies to the fetus.17,18

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have granted several key designations to nipocalimab including:

• EU EMA Orphan medicinal product designation for hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) in October 2019 and fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) in April 2025

• U.S. FDA Fast Track designation in HDFN and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) in July 2019, gMG in December 2021, FNAIT in March 2024 and Sjögren’s disease (SjD) in March 2025

• U.S. FDA Orphan drug status for wAIHA in December 2019, HDFN in June 2020, gMG in February 2021, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) in October 2021 and FNAIT in December 2023

• U.S. FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation for HDFN in February 2024 and for Sjögren’s disease in November 2024

• U.S. FDA granted Priority Review in generalized myasthenia gravis in Q4 2024

""This fleet investment builds on the strong foundation Alaska has created to support steady, scalable and sustained growth, and is another building block in executing our Alaska Accelerate strategic plan,"" said Alaska Air Group CEO and President Ben Minicucci.

The 787 Dreamliner order supports Alaska Airlines' long-haul growth plans, enabling the airline to expand its international network with industry-leading fuel efficiency, range and passenger comfort. The 787's advanced aerodynamics, composite structure and modern cabin design make it well-suited for long-range international markets.

The renovation reaffirms the company’s commitment to its local workforce and underscores the company’s expanded operations in Taiwan and the broader Asia‑Pacific region.

The renovated headquarters covers approximately 2,900 square meters and centralizes functions, including strategic planning, operations, marketing, human resources, sales, information technology, legal, and finance. The redesign reflects the FedEx People‑Service‑Profit philosophy and introduces amenities to enhance employee well‑being and collaboration, such as multi‑purpose lounge areas, a nursing room, a quiet room, sit‑stand desks, dedicated collaboration zones, and accessible design elements.

Smart office technologies have been integrated to boost efficiency and support global collaboration, including smart meeting room systems, real-time network redundancy, workflow management tools, intelligent networking, Wi-Fi 6 coverage, and upgraded video conferencing systems. Biophilic design is a key element of the upgrade. The new office incorporates low-carbon and recycled building materials to create a modern workplace infused with natural elements.

“Taiwan is a strategic market for FedEx. By upgrading our headquarters, we are improving the work environment and service capabilities for our people while enhancing supply chain resilience to meet the stringent timing and reliability requirements of key industries such as semiconductors, electronics and e‑commerce,” said Paul Sousa, managing director, FedEx Taiwan. “Going forward, FedEx will continue to invest in innovative logistics solutions to help Taiwan businesses accelerate regional and global growth, while advancing shared prosperity with local partners.”

FedEx continues to strengthen its investment in Taiwan by enhancing its cross-border transportation network and local operational capabilities to support Taiwanese businesses in playing an increasingly critical role in global supply chains. In response to rising demand from the semiconductor, high-tech manufacturing, and cross-border e-commerce sectors, FedEx recently introduced a new daily flight between Taiwan and Incheon, South Korea, improving overall transit times, network coverage, and cut-off flexibility. Through deeper integration with its Asia Pacific hub network, FedEx aims to deliver more efficient and competitive cross-border logistics solutions.

Since beginning operations at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in 1990 and opening its first Taipei station on Jianguo North Road, FedEx Taiwan has expanded significantly.

(NYSE: FDX) today released its third annual FedEx Returns Survey in collaboration with Morning Consult, revealing consumers and businesses alike are prioritizing simple, flexible, and transparent returns experiences. While consumers are actively avoiding costly return fees, going into 2026, retailers are shifting towards fee-based models as they try to balance costs while maintaining a positive customer experience. The findings show AI-driven tools and increasing familiarity with no-box, no-label returns are helping both shoppers and retailers navigate the returns process more efficiently.

Using AI to streamline returns

AI-powered tools and features are becoming an increasingly important part of the returns experience. One in five consumers report using AI-powered chatbots to find information about shipping and returns. While trust in these tools is still developing, 53% of consumers who have interacted with AI-powered customer service during the returns process say the experience was more satisfying than working with a human support agent.

“At a time when returns are becoming more frequent and more complex, reducing friction is critical for customers—especially following the busiest shopping season of the year,” said Jason Brenner, senior vice president, digital portfolio at FedEx. “AI is playing an increasingly central role in that effort, including helping shoppers source information about a brand’s returns policy, leveraging AI-powered customer support, and personalized AI-generated recommendations to streamline their return.”

Convenience and clarity shape shopping and business decisions

In the lead up to the 2025 holiday season, 40% of U.S. consumers polled believe they will be returning the same (29%) or more items (11%) than previous years. Millennials and Gen Z are the most likely to be influenced by return fees from retailers.

Return policies continue to shape purchasing decisions with nearly 66% of consumers saying a retailer’s return policy influences whether they make a purchase, rising to 75% among Millennials. Fees remain a particular pain point, with 59% of consumers saying they would consider avoiding a retailer that charges a return fee. This is especially true among Gen X (65%) and baby boomers (72%).

No-box, no-label returns on the rise

While in-person returns remain the most trusted option, confidence in alternative methods is rising as experience with simplified return processes grows.

Familiarity with no-box, no-label returns among consumers who have made returns rose to 48%, up from 37% in 2024, while usage increased to 41%, up from 31% last year. These options are most often described as convenient, straightforward, and stress-free, reflecting a broader expectation that returns should be as easy as the purchase itself.

About the FedEx Returns Survey

Morning Consult conducted two surveys, one among consumers and one among merchants, as part of the FedEx 2025 Returns Survey, the company’s third annual study. The consumer survey was conducted between December 4 and December 9, 2025, among a sample of 1,980 U.S. consumers. Results from the full consumer survey have a margin of error of +/- 2%. The merchants survey was conducted during the same period among a sample of 1,008 U.S. merchants. Results from the full merchants survey have a margin of error of +/- 3%. The surveys examined return behaviors, attitudes, and expectations related to convenience, fees, no-box, no-label returns, and the growing role of AI in the returns process.

In 2021, FedEx has set a goal to achieve carbon-neutral operations across its global operations by 2040. To accelerate FedEx’s sustainability drive and support its global carbon-neutral ambition in Hong Kong, FedEx is transforming its last-mile delivery operations through fleet electrification. Earlier this year, FedEx has expanded the Hong Kong delivery fleet by adding new electric vehicles (EVs) for parcel pickup and delivery operations.

Additionally, FedEx has been collaborating with local social enterprises to recycle logistical waste, including upcycling aging uniform into brand new FedEx products， and transforming wood skids into cat litter as well as reusable materials for other shipping companies. Other collaborative activities including tree-planting and beach cleanup initiatives, which help foster sustainable and positive growth within the local community.

Over the years, FedEx has been embedding sustainability into its culture by investing in future talent and working with nonprofits to expand opportunity and uphold dignity and respect for all. Through collaborative community initiatives such as FedEx/Junior Achievement International Trade Challenge (FedEx/JA ITC), they equip young people, veterans, and students with practical skills, career exposure, and pathways to employment.

These sustained efforts reflect FedEx’s broader commitment to embedding sustainability into its business operations and community, and to delivering long-term value for its customers and stakeholders as well as its employee and the wider community in Hong Kong.",positive

This offer is for shares representing less than 0.04 percent of the outstanding shares of RTX common stock. This offer price is approximately 24.02% below the closing price of RTX common stock on December 5, 2025($171.10), the last trading day before the date of the offer, and is approximately 31.72% below the closing price of RTX common stock on January 6, 2026($190.40), the day prior to this release. The offer price of $130.00 per share is conditioned on, among other things, the closing price per share of RTX common stock exceeding $130.00 per share on the last trading day before the offer expires. This means that unless this condition is waived by Tutanota, RTX shareholders who tender their shares in the offer will sell their shares at a below-market price.

RTX recommends that shareholders do not tender their shares in response to Tutanota's offer because the offer is at a price below the market value for shares of RTX common stock (as of the last trading day prior to the offer) and is subject to numerous additional conditions including Tutanota's ability to obtain financing. RTX shareholders who have already tendered their shares are advised they may withdraw them by following the procedures for withdrawal described in the Tutanota offer documents prior to the expiration of the offer, which is currently scheduled for 5:00 p.m. EST on January 12, 2026, unless extended or earlier terminated.

RTX does not endorse Tutanota's unsolicited mini-tender offer and is not affiliated or associated in any way with Tutanota, its mini-tender offer, or the offer documentation.

Tutanota has previously made similar mini-tender offers for shares of other companies. Mini-tender offers seek to acquire less than 5 percent of a company's shares outstanding, thereby avoiding many disclosure and procedural requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that apply to offers for more than 5 percent of a company's shares outstanding. As a result, mini-tender offers do not provide investors with the same level of protections as provided by larger tender offers under U.S. securities laws. The SEC has cautioned investors about mini-tender offers, noting that some bidders make mini-tender offers at below-market prices, ""hoping that they will catch investors off guard if the investors do not compare the offer price to the current market price."" The SEC's guidance to investors on mini-tender offers is available at https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/minitend.htm.

RTX urges investors to obtain current market quotations for their shares, to consult with their broker or financial advisor and to exercise caution with respect to Tutanota's offer. RTX encourages brokers and dealers, as well as other market participants, to review the SEC's letter regarding broker-dealer mini-tender offer dissemination and disclosures at https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/minitenders/sia072401.htm.

RTX requests that a copy of this release be included with all distributions of materials relating to Tutanota's mini-tender offer related to shares of RTX common stock.

This offer is for shares representing less than 0.04 percent of the outstanding shares of RTX common stock.
This offer price is approximately 24.02% below the closing price of RTX common stock on December 5, 2025($171.10), the last trading day before the date of the offer, and is approximately 31.72% below the closing price of RTX common stock on January 6, 2026($190.40), the day prior to this release.

This offer is for shares representing less than 0.04 percent of the outstanding shares of RTX common stock. This offer price is approximately 24.02% below the closing price of RTX common stock on December 5, 2025($171.10), the last trading day before the date of the offer, and is approximately 31.72% below the closing price of RTX common stock on January 6, 2026($190.40), the day prior to this release. The offer price of $130.00 per share is conditioned on, among other things, the closing price per share of RTX common stock exceeding $130.00 per share on the last trading day before the offer expires. This means that unless this condition is waived by Tutanota, RTX shareholders who tender their shares in the offer will sell their shares at a below-market price.

RTX recommends that shareholders do not tender their shares in response to Tutanota's offer because the offer is at a price below the market value for shares of RTX common stock (as of the last trading day prior to the offer) and is subject to numerous additional conditions including Tutanota's ability to obtain financing. RTX shareholders who have already tendered their shares are advised they may withdraw them by following the procedures for withdrawal described in the Tutanota offer documents prior to the expiration of the offer, which is currently scheduled for 5:00 p.m. EST on January 12, 2026, unless extended or earlier terminated.

RTX does not endorse Tutanota's unsolicited mini-tender offer and is not affiliated or associated in any way with Tutanota, its mini-tender offer, or the offer documentation.

Tutanota has previously made similar mini-tender offers for shares of other companies. Mini-tender offers seek to acquire less than 5 percent of a company's shares outstanding, thereby avoiding many disclosure and procedural requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that apply to offers for more than 5 percent of a company's shares outstanding. As a result, mini-tender offers do not provide investors with the same level of protections as provided by larger tender offers under U.S. securities laws. The SEC has cautioned investors about mini-tender offers, noting that some bidders make mini-tender offers at below-market prices, ""hoping that they will catch investors off guard if the investors do not compare the offer price to the current market price."" The SEC's guidance to investors on mini-tender offers is available at https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/minitend.htm.

RTX urges investors to obtain current market quotations for their shares, to consult with their broker or financial advisor and to exercise caution with respect to Tutanota's offer. RTX encourages brokers and dealers, as well as other market participants, to review the SEC's letter regarding broker-dealer mini-tender offer dissemination and disclosures at https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/minitenders/sia072401.htm.

RTX requests that a copy of this release be included with all distributions of materials relating to Tutanota's mini-tender offer related to shares of RTX common stock.

Stay active in the new year with Apple Watch

Fitness+ offers an exciting new lineup of programs, Artist Spotlight workouts, and Time To Walk episodes to support users in reaching their goals



New research from the Apple Heart and Movement Study shows participants with Apple Watch keep up their exercise levels well into the new year

Apple Watch is the ultimate fitness and health companion to support users in reaching and maintaining their goals in 2026. And this month, new programs are coming to Apple Fitness+, the award-winning fitness and wellness service, to help users stay active.

Apple Watch offers daily fitness motivation to millions of people across the globe, along with powerful insights into their workouts, training, and health. A new analysis of data from the Apple Heart and Movement Study identified participants with Apple Watch consistently increase their exercise levels in January and maintain them well into the new year. For additional motivation, Apple Watch users can earn the Ring in the New Year limited-edition award and participate in an Apple Watch “Quit Quitting” Challenge on Strava this month.

Starting January 5, Apple Fitness+ introduces four brand-new workout programs that offer users weekly training plans to help take the guesswork out of how to reach their goals. The Artist Spotlight series launches new workouts with full playlists featuring KAROL G and Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show superstar Bad Bunny. And this season of Time to Walk features new episodes with Penn Badgley, Mel B, and Michelle Monaghan.

Apple Watch Helps Users Stay Motivated and Consistent in the New Year

Many people give up their New Year’s fitness resolutions by the second Friday in January, also known as Quitter’s Day. A new analysis of data contributed by approximately 100,000 participants in the Apple Heart and Movement Study over four years identified participants with Apple Watch consistently keep up their exercise levels through Quitter’s Day and beyond.

Each year, following a decrease in average exercise minutes during the November and December holiday period, the average daily exercise minutes of Apple Watch users in the study not only rapidly increased in January, but also continued to progress into the spring. During the first two weeks of January, over 60 percent of Apple Watch users increased their daily exercise minutes by over 10 percent from their December average. Notably, many Apple Watch users kept up those exercise levels through Quitter’s Day and into the following months. Nearly 80 percent of those who increased their exercise minutes maintained those increased exercise levels through the second half of January, with 90 percent of that group also maintaining elevated levels through February and March.

The analysis included study participants who elected to share Activity data and consistently wore their Apple Watch over multiple years. The Apple Heart and Movement Study, conducted in collaboration with Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the American Heart Association, and Apple, included over 250,000 people across the United States who consented to participate.1

Get and Stay Active with an Apple Watch Limited-Edition Award and Challenge in Strava

To kick off the new year, Apple Watch users can earn the Ring in the New Year limited-edition award when they close all three Activity rings for seven days in a row in January.

For the first time, Strava users with an Apple Watch can also participate in a special “Quit Quitting” challenge in the Strava app throughout the month of January to help motivate them to stay active and committed. After joining the challenge, users who log 12 workouts anytime within the month will earn an Apple Watch badge in the Strava app.

New Fitness+ Programs to Restart, Refocus, and Recommit

Fitness+, now available in 48 countries and regions around the world, is introducing a new series of multiweek programs designed to help build momentum and stay consistent in the new year. For users looking to return to working out, the Make Your Fitness Comeback program features three popular workout types: Strength, HIIT, and Yoga. The four-week plan features three workouts per week — one of each type — for just 10 minutes. Every week builds on the previous week to help users progress in their journey to return to fitness.

The Build a Yoga Habit in 4 Weeks program is designed to help users add yoga into their fitness routine. These workouts are designed to increase flexibility, cut down on stress, and build strength and stability. Every week, users will get two 10-minute flows — one slow and one energetic — that complement their existing workout routines and help build a habit.

The Back-to-Back Strength and HIIT program provides three 20-minute workouts pairing these two popular workout types on Fitness+: 10 minutes of Strength and 10 minutes of HIIT, three times per week, over the course of three weeks. The workouts are designed to be done one right after the other with no break in between.

Strength training is one of the fastest-growing workout types in the world, and the Strength Basics in 3 Weeks program helps users who are new to strength training learn the fundamentals, while those returning to a strength routine, they can brush up on solid technique for common moves. The program launches January 12 and consists of three workouts per week, each one focusing on a different body area, to learn and practice common strength moves to build confidence and improve users’ technique.

Music That Moves and New Guests in Time to Walk

The Fitness+ Artist Spotlight series returns with new workouts featuring music from world-renowned artists. New workouts include the music of Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter KAROL G, and dropping February 2, Fitness+ adds new workouts to the Bad Bunny Artist Spotlight series, celebrating the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show.

The award-winning Time to Walk series — where guests share stories, photos, and songs that shaped their lives — brings new episodes starting with actor and producer Penn Badgley; Spice Girls member, singer, songwriter, and TV personality Mel B; and actor Michelle Monaghan to follow later this year.

More Ways to Keep Moving with Apple

Fitness+ is available anytime, anywhere, on iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV. When users have Apple Watch or AirPods Pro 3, the experience is even more motivating with their personal metrics displayed onscreen during a workout — including real-time heart rate and calories burned.2,3

Users can follow a premade, personalized Custom Plan or create their own Custom Plan by selecting workout days, preferred activities, durations, trainers, and music. Fitness+ then provides a personalized schedule of workouts with reminder notifications to help maintain consistency.

Strava subscribers can receive up to three months of Fitness+ at no cost.4 Users can also share a Fitness+ workout to Strava, and the Strava app will display rich details to track their fitness journey and share with their community on Strava.

Apple Watch is the world’s most popular watch, and throughout the year, Apple Watch offers users motivating and actionable insights that break down barriers between users and their fitness and health information. Users can also:

Track a wide range of workouts with scientifically validated custom heart rate and calorie algorithms in the Workout app, which uses a powerful AI and ML model for motion — trained on 50 million hours of activity data — to provide advanced metrics for running, cycling, swimming, hiking, and more.

Stay motivated with Activity challenges and sharing, keep an eye on their progress with weekly summaries and trends, and monitor key fitness metrics like training load, cardio fitness, and cardio recovery.

Track their sleep, receive insights on heart health, track their menstrual cycle, manage their medications, monitor environmental noise levels, and more.

Benefit from a suite of third-party app experiences like Strava and Runna for runners; Golfshot and 18Birdies for golfers; and more.

The Apple Watch lineup supports everyone’s goals in the new year:

Apple Watch Series 11 offers the most comprehensive set of health features yet with hypertension notifications and the ECG app, longer battery life, an even more durable cover glass, and 5G cellular capabilities, all in its thinnest and most comfortable design.

Apple Watch SE 3 offers remarkable health, fitness, connectivity, and safety features, and the powerful capabilities of the S10 chip including an Always-On display and fast charging, at an incredible value.

Apple Watch Ultra 3, the ultimate sports and adventure watch, features Emergency SOS via satellite, the largest display ever in an Apple Watch, 42-hour battery life, and powerful health insights.

Pricing and Availability

Apple Watch Series 11 starts at $399 (U.S.), Apple Watch SE 3 starts at $249 (U.S.), and Apple Watch Ultra 3 starts at $799 (U.S.). Apple Watch Ultra 3, Apple Watch Series 11, and Apple Watch SE 3 require iPhone 11 or later with iOS 26 or later.

Apple Fitness+ is available as a subscription service for $9.99 (U.S.) per month or $79.99 (U.S.) per year, and can be shared with up to five other family members.

A Front-Row Experience for Lakers Fans

Apple Immersive places Apple Vision Pro users at the center of live events and stories as they unfold. Spectrum Front Row in Apple Immersive is directed and produced for Vision Pro with a feed of up to 150 Mbps and seven unique viewing angles: the scorer’s table, the area beneath each basket, a high-and-wide view of the arena, the player tunnel, the broadcast booth, and a roaming courtside perspective for interviews and commentary. The broadcast team features Emmy Award-winning play-by-play commentator Mark Rogondino and three-time NBA champion and former Lakers forward Danny Green as an analyst.

Spectrum Front Row in Apple Immersive brings viewers closer to each pass, shot, and block. In-game graphics like lower thirds, player rosters, the game and shot clocks, and scores appear in 3D, as if they’re floating directly in front of the viewer. Ambisonic microphones capture Spatial Audio of the arena, so viewers hear the crisp squeaks of sneakers driving up and down the court, the swish of the net when a player drains a three-pointer, and the roar of the crowd during intense moments of gameplay. During timeouts, halftimes, and other breaks in the action, the broadcast remains live inside the arena, showcasing pregame introductions, team huddles, and even in-arena entertainment.

By implementing these technologies, the bank is building a strong foundation for real-time observability, automated resource optimization, and advanced integration. This integrated approach is designed to improve resilience, minimize downtime, optimize IT resources, and deliver faster, more reliable digital banking experiences for its customers.

As Egypt’s financial sector rapidly shifts toward more innovative, more agile digital banking models, Bank NXT is modernizing its core technology environment to overcome legacy limitations and build a scalable, adaptive digital foundation. This transformation aims to enhance operational efficiency, accelerate service delivery, and strengthen the bank’s ability to collaborate seamlessly with fintech partners, enabling secure and innovative customer experiences.

To improve application performance and resource efficiency, Bank NXT deployed IBM Instana® for real-time observability across its digital banking applications, enabling proactive monitoring and faster issue resolution, thereby enhancingcustomer experiences. In parallel, IBM Turbonomic® delivers automated, intelligent resource optimization across hybrid cloud environments, helping the bank maximize IT utilization, reduce operational costs, and maintain consistent performance at scale.

To further drive operational excellence, Bank NXT implemented IBM Cloud Pak® for Integration and IBM Cloud Pak® for Business Automation, running on Red Hat® OpenShift®, to create a unified digital platform that streamlines operations, reduces system complexity, and supports faster development and deployment of new services. This shift has enabled more efficient service delivery through a continuous delivery model, improved cost optimization, and increased platform reliability.

By adopting the DevOps model and improving our business automation capabilities, we have enhanced the flexibility of our technology infrastructure. This advancement prepares us to integrate with fintech companies through an API-driven ecosystem, fostering a more open and innovative environment. Tamer Seif, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Bank NXT, stated, “This progress strengthens the reliability of the bank’s digital platform and boosts operational efficiency. It accelerates service delivery and expands the range of digital solutions we offer, ultimately leading to a better customer experience and faster, more responsive service.”

“IBM is proud to support Bank NXT in building a high-performance, cloud-native digital banking environment powered by real-time observability, intelligent resource optimization, integration, and automation,” said Marwa Abbas, General Manager and Technology Leader, IBM Northeast Africa; “With IBM Instana and IBM Turbonomic at the core of this transformation, Bank NXT gains the visibility and control needed to improve resilience, optimize performance at scale, and drive innovation. This collaboration also reflects the strength of our strategic partner ecosystem, with Inspire playing a central role in successful execution.”

“As a proud IBM Platinum Business Partner, our collaboration with Bank NXT goes beyond a technology implementation, it is a shared journey toward full digital transformation.” said Kamal Haddad, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Inspire for Solutions Development.“Over the past six months, Bank NXT’s teams have developed strong technical and operational capabilities through our close collaboration, and the results have been remarkable. The progress achieved so far sets the stage for even greater milestones ahead.”

A core component of Bank NXT’s modernization initiative focuses on capability building to ensure long-term sustainability. Bank NXT teams are being upskilled through structured workshops and online training programs covering observability, integration, automation, and DevOps practices. This approach strengthens in-house expertise and supports the bank’s roadmap to expand digital services across its business lines continuously.

Through this collaboration, Inspire for Solutions Development played a key role in establishing the digital foundation that enabled Bank NXT’s transformation,from observability and resource optimization to integration, automation implementation, and delivery frameworks.

Dal lancio del sito web di Wimbledon nel 1995 e dell'app mobile nel 2009, alla prima integrazione di soluzioni avanzate basate sull'intelligenza artificiale nel 2017, IBM e l'All England Club collaborano da 36 anni per migliorare il coinvolgimento dei fan di tutto il mondo attraverso le piattaforme digitali di Wimbledon.

La partnership consolidata tra IBM e l'All England Club ha da tempo stabilito lo standard per la creazione di funzionalità coinvolgenti rivolte ai fan che hanno alzato il livello dell'innovazione tecnologica nello sport. Basandosi su oltre trent'anni di innovazione continua, il nuovo accordo si concentra su iniziative volte ad ampliare la portata globale dell'evento e a ottenere un coinvolgimento più profondo dei fan nell'ecosistema digitale di Wimbledon nel 2026 e negli anni a venire.

I team di IBM e dell'All England Club lavorano insieme tutto l'anno per creare esperienze uniche per i fan, come Live Likelihood to Win e Match Chat, che combinano l'enorme quantità di dati generati durante il torneo con le avanzate capacità di intelligenza artificiale di IBM watsonx. Nel 2025, questi sforzi hanno contribuito a un aumento del 16% rispetto all'anno precedente del coinvolgimento su tutte le piattaforme, con oltre 20 milioni di appassionati che hanno seguito da vicino tutte le azioni sul campo in erba tramite l'app e il sito web. La sola app ha registrato un aumento del 19% del tasso di coinvolgimento e ha ricevuto una valutazione media eccezionale, pari a 4,9 stelle negli app store.

La partnership ha anche vinto numerosi premi, tra cui il riconoscimento dell'All England Club come “Organizzazione sportiva dell'anno” agli Sports Technology Awards 2025, per l'uso innovativo dell'intelligenza artificiale e della tecnologia al fine di trasformare l'esperienza dei tifosi di Wimbledon.

“Siamo lieti del rinnovo pluriennale della nostra partnership consolidata con IBM”, ha dichiarato Usama Al-Qassab, Direttore Marketing e Commerciale dell'All England Lawn Tennis Club. “Da 36 anni IBM e l'All England Club abbracciano l'innovazione e creano esperienze digitali all'avanguardia a livello mondiale per avvicinare i nostri fan al torneo. Con l’obiettivo di attrarre la prossima generazione di tifosi di Wimbledon da tutto il mondo, le capacità basate sull'intelligenza artificiale di IBM saranno fondamentali per garantire che le nostre future esperienze digitali siano pertinenti, personalizzate e coinvolgenti”.

“L'All England Club è un'organizzazione visionaria, che gestisce una delle proprietà più riconoscibili a livello globale nel campo dello sport e della cultura in generale. Siamo entusiasti di continuare a lavorare fianco a fianco come partner per offrire un'esperienza digitale di livello mondiale, guidata dai dati e dalla tecnologia di AI”, ha affermato Jonathan Adashek, Senior Vice President, Marketing e Comunicazione, IBM. “Sia che vivano il torneo in presenza o che lo seguano da qualsiasi angolo del globo negli anni a venire, centinaia di milioni di appassionati di tennis potranno contare su funzionalità digitali interattive, alimentate da watsonx, per rimanere in contatto con la bellezza, lo spettacolo e l'emozione dei Campionati”.

Secondo un nuovo sondaggio condotto a livello globale da IBM e Morning Consult pubblicato la scorsa estate, l'86% degli appassionati di tennis in tutto il mondo riconosce il valore delle funzionalità basate sull'intelligenza artificiale, con approfondimenti in tempo reale e highlights personalizzati fondamentali per il loro coinvolgimento.

Insieme, IBM e l'All England Club continuano a impegnarsi nello sviluppo di nuove tecnologie che rendano il torneo più accessibile e coinvolgente per milioni di appassionati, contribuendo alla crescita esponenziale del tennis sulla scena mondiale.

To thrive, companies are doubling down on technologies that provide speed, resilience, and insight. AI has shifted from experimental to essential, redefining decisions, roles, and customer expectations at an unprecedented pace. Enterprises are moving towards operating with AI at the core, and soon, quantum will help tackle their most complex problems.

“The findings point to a fundamental shift in how organizations are approaching growth and competitiveness in 2026,” said Shukri Eid, General Manager, IBM Gulf Levant and Pakistan. “In the UAE, leaders are accelerating decision-making, embedding AI at the core of their operations, and strengthening resilience and sovereignty across their technology environments. At the same time, there is a clear focus on building trust - with employees, customers, and partners - as AI becomes more deeply integrated into everyday business. Together, these priorities are shaping organizations that are better prepared to adapt, collaborate across ecosystems, and take advantage of emerging technologies such as quantum.”

Fast decisions turn disruption into opportunity

Of the executives surveyed in the UAE, 95% say they increasingly need to make fast decisions, and all believe the highest-stakes decisions they made in 2025 were the right ones – that’s 4% above the global average. Uncertainty can become the greatest business asset for those who embrace it, with 63% of the respondents saying economic and geopolitical volatility will create new business opportunities for their organizations in 2026. The report notes that 93% of UAE executives fear they’ll lose their edge if they can’t operate in real time.

Employees are ready to embrace AI-driven role changes

The research shows that employees no longer fear AI – they want to embrace it, even if that means their roles will change significantly. Globally, 81% are confident they can keep up with new technologies, and 61% think AI makes their job less mundane and more strategic. Across all generational groups – from digital natives to seasoned veterans – at least twice as many employees would welcome rather than resist greater use of AI by their employers in 2026. In addition, 63% would work with an AI agent.

Consumers are excited about AI, but transparency is mandatory

While consumers don’t need AI to be flawless, they do need to be in the loop. Easy-to-understand explanations of how AI is using their data are what make consumers most comfortable engaging with it. Among the consumers surveyed worldwide, 89% want to know when they’re interacting with AI, and four in five say they would trust a brand less if it intentionally concealed AI use. Two-thirds would switch brands – and half would even pay more – to avoid hidden AI. Meanwhile, 95% of global executives believe consumer trust in their AI will define the success of new products and services.

AI resilience and sovereignty become essential

In the face of growing uncertainty, AI resilience and sovereignty – an organization’s ability to control and govern its AI systems, data, and infrastructure at all times – have become mission-critical. In the UAE, 98% of executives say AI resilience and sovereignty must be part of their 2026 strategy, and 63% worry about overdependence on compute resources.

Quantum will require deep ecosystem collaboration

Quantum demands resources no single entity can realistically maintain alone – in short, it takes an ecosystem, or several. Quantum-ready organizations (QROs) worldwide are three times more likely to participate in multiple ecosystems than their least ready counterparts. In the UAE, four in five executives (80%) say ecosystem partners help accelerate technology adoption, while 88% believe these partners enable their company to limit the impact of disruption, and an equal number agree that partner data improves business outcomes. The findings indicate that enterprises forging the best ecosystem alliances today are positioning themselves to lead in the quantum era.

- En France, l’utilisation par les consommateurs d’applications d’IA comme ChatGPT et Google Gemini a augmenté de 90 % en 2 ans.

Paris, le 7 janvier 2026 : Une nouvelle étude mondiale menée par l'IBM Institute for Business Value et la National Retail Federation (NRF)*, intitulée « Own the agentic commerce experience - Consumers are ready », montre que si la plupart des consommateurs préfèrent encore faire leurs achats en magasin, près de la moitié d'entre eux utilisent désormais l'IA pour guider leurs achats, de la recherche de produits à celle de bonnes affaires. La crise économique affectant la moitié des consommateurs interrogés et modifiant leurs habitudes d'achat, les marques doivent prendre en compte ces nouveaux comportements pour concevoir des interactions basées sur l'IA qui correspondent aux nouveaux besoins des consommateurs.



L'adoption de solutions basées sur l'IA a connu un essor fulgurant ces dernières années, et le commerce conversationnel est à la pointe de cette évolution. Même si les consommateurs se montrent disposés à partager leurs données, la confiance demeure un enjeu majeur : la majorité d’entre eux s’inquiète de la confidentialité, de l’utilisation abusive et des sollicitations non désirées. L'opportunité est claire pour les marques : celles qui intègrent l'IA de façon transparente, garantissent la transparence dans chaque interaction et conçoivent des expériences qui répondent à la fois aux besoins des consommateurs et de leurs assistants IA définiront la prochaine ère du commerce de détail.

L'IA transforme le comportement d'achat, guidant les consommateurs dans leurs recherches et leurs choix.

En France, 78 % des consommateurs continuent de faire leurs achats en magasin, mais le shopping assisté par l’IA connaît une forte croissance :

40 % utilisent l’IA pour les aider dans leur intention d’achat – dont 34 % pour rechercher des produits, 27 % pour consulter des avis et 24 % pour trouver des offres.

L’utilisation par les consommateurs d’applications d’IA comme ChatGPT et Google Gemini a augmenté de 90% au cours des deux dernières années. Ce chiffre est supérieur de 28 points par rapport à la moyenne mondiale.

Le commerce conversationnel est à l’origine de cette évolution, les consommateurs se tournant vers l’IA via le chat, la voix et la messagerie pour rechercher et acheter des produits. Si 30 % des consommateurs français apprécient les magasins élégants où ils n’ont pas à attendre, les solutions basées sur l’IA sont presque aussi importantes :

22 % recherchent des super applications qui combinent le commerce avec d’autres services.

27 % veulent des foyers connectés avec des assistants personnels d'achat basés sur l'IA et 30 % une livraison autonome.

Seuls 19 % des consommateurs français recherchent des plateformes sociales qui facilitent les achats. Ce chiffre est inférieur de 10 points par rapport au chiffre mondial.

Les consommateurs partageront leurs données, mais uniquement si les marques gagnent leur confiance en faisant preuve de transparence et en garantissant leur sécurité.

Près de 6 consommateurs français sur 10 ne veulent pas partager leurs données. Et 83 % d’entre eux sont préoccupés par la sécurité.

Les consommateurs français se méfient de la manière dont leurs données seront utilisées : 30 % citent les risques liés à la confidentialité, 37 % craignent une utilisation abusive, et 31 % s’inquiètent que leurs données puissent être vendues sans consentement.

Seuls 17 % des consommateurs français, font entièrement confiance aux recommandations de l’IA, tandis que 8 % valident le contenu des réseaux sociaux, et 22 % recoupent les sources lorsqu’ils recherchent des produits.

Parallèlement, au niveau mondial, les entreprises mettent en place des mesures pour gagner la confiance des clients : audits de vulnérabilité par des organismes externes (56 %), prévention des failles de sécurité grâce à l’IA (50 %) et chiffrement de bout en bout des interactions (45 %).

Les agents IA passent du concept à la réalité — et les consommateurs savent déjà ce qu’ils veulent.

En France, les quatre types d’agents IA les plus plébiscités sont : le chasseur de bonnes affaires (34 %), le conseiller clientèle (28 %), l’agent d’avis produits (23 %) et le « personal shopper » (23 %).

Près de la moitié (49 %) des dirigeants, au niveau mondial, déclarent que leur organisation propose des agents de service client, mais beaucoup moins déploient des chasseurs de bonnes affaires (35 %), des agents d’achat (31 %), des conseillers lifestyle (30 %) ou des analyseurs d’avis produits (28 %).

Les dirigeants reconnaissent le potentiel de l’IA, mais les défis liés à son intégration ralentissent les progrès.

Près de la moitié (48 %) des responsables de grandes marques, au niveau mondial, déclarent avoir amélioré l’engagement client via l’IA conversationnelle, et 37 % mentionnent un parcours d’achat omnicanal plus fluide.

Plus de la moitié (54 %) au niveau mondial, signalent des difficultés persistantes entre les différents canaux et systèmes, 51 % mentionnent un manque d’expertise en matière d’IA, et environ deux sur cinq font état d’une résistance organisationnelle et de difficultés à appliquer l’IA à leurs opérations internationales.

« Les entreprises, tous secteurs confondus, qui ont mis des années à maîtriser l’engagement client via les moteurs de recherche (Google en tête) et le SEO (référencement naturel), doivent désormais « réapprendre » ces mécanismes transformés par l’IA générative. Il ne s’agit plus seulement d’acheter des mots-clés, mais de repenser le référencement naturel en fonction de la manière dont les agents IA analysent et synthétisent le contenu de leurs pages produits. Ce travail de fond implique une maîtrise du fonctionnement de ces IA, combinée à leur savoir-faire marketing » indique Arnaud Pelletier, Executive Partner chez IBM Consulting en France.

Connectez-vous avec IBM à la NRF 2026 : Le commerce de détail entre dans un moment charnière. Les attentes des clients ne cessent d’augmenter, les opérations deviennent plus complexes et les marges sont de plus en plus sous pression. L’IA n’est plus un projet secondaire : elle devient le moteur de la productivité, de la fidélisation et de la croissance. Pourtant, la plupart des détaillants peinent encore à dépasser la phase pilote et à déployer l’IA à grande échelle dans les magasins, la chaîne d’approvisionnement, le merchandising et l’engagement client. Rejoignez-nous pour découvrir comment transformer l’ambition d’IA en impact opérationnel, et comment des leaders du retail utilisent l’IA agentique — une IA qui agit, apprend et collabore — pour simplifier les décisions, améliorer les expériences et libérer l’efficacité à l’échelle de l’entreprise.

*Méthodologie de l'étude :

Pour analyser comment les consommateurs et les dirigeants d’entreprise se préparent au shopping assisté par l’IA et au commerce agentique, l’IBM Institute for Business Value a mené deux enquêtes mondiales au troisième trimestre 2025 : l’une auprès des consommateurs et l’autre auprès des dirigeants du secteur. L’enquête consommateurs a inclus plus de 18 000 répondants issus de 23 pays, représentant des comportements d’achat variés. L’enquête auprès des dirigeants a recueilli des informations auprès de 200 cadres supérieurs dans les secteurs du retail, des biens de consommation et du e-commerce. Les répondants ont été segmentés selon leur style d’engagement, leur sensibilité au prix et leur niveau de connaissance lié à l’IA. Des analyses descriptives ont permis d’identifier les principaux schémas, et des techniques statistiques validées ont été appliquées pour comparer les priorités et évaluer les stratégies d’engagement axées sur la confiance.

From hyper-personalized suggestions to curated inspiration, influence now begins long before a store visit or app tap, moving where brands and retailers compete to an entirely new level.

A new global study* from the IBM (NYSE: IBM) Institute for Business Value, in collaboration with the National Retail Federation (NRF), found that while nearly three-quarters of surveyed consumers (72%) still shop in stores, almost half (45%) turn to AI for help during their buying journeys. Shoppers still want to see and touch products, but today's savvy consumers increasingly arrive with a sense of what they're looking for and why. They are using AI to research products (41%), interpret reviews (33%), and hunt for deals (31%).

""AI is changing how consumers shop, and every aspect throughout the shopping journey,"" notes Caroline Reppert, Senior Director, AI and Technology Policy at the National Retail Federation, ""As these technologies increasingly guide consumer discovery, comparison, and choice, retailers that understand and respond to this shift will be best positioned to earn trust, relevance, and long-term customer loyalty.""

From browsing to guided buying: How AI is shaping choices

For leading brands and retailers, this shift toward AI-shaped discovery is prompting a rethink of how and where they engage consumers.

As Matthieu Houle, CIO at ALDO Group, explains, ""AI is turning shopping into a trusted conversation, much more than a search. Consumers now rely on assistants that feel almost human, know their preferences, and offer neutral, best-for-me advice that reshapes how they validate and decide what to buy.""

While 35% of surveyed consumers still desire visually appealing stores with no wait times, AI-powered solutions are nearly as important. In fact, one in three consumers seek super apps that combine commerce with other services, 30% want smart homes with AI personal shoppers and autonomous delivery, and 29% look for effortless purchasing through social platforms.

Consumers are growing increasingly accustomed to AI-powered shopping assistants helping them decide what to buy. That expectation, however, is forming faster than most retail operating models can keep pace, forcing the question: Is our data ready to guide and validate what customers ultimately choose?

""AI is not a magic wand,"" emphasizes Stanislas Vignon, Head of Insights (AI and Omnichannel) at Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH), ""If you don't have the right data, it doesn't work. And you must test your solution to know whether it works and where it will bring value.""

How brands and retailers can stay ahead of AI-driven consumers

As AI transforms how consumers make choices, brands and retailers need to anticipate change and intentionally design experiences that meet shoppers where they are, with focus on:

Redesign the journey around future decision moments. Identify where consumers will use AI to research, compare, and look for value, and ensure those moments connect seamlessly to purchase.

Identify where consumers will use AI to research, compare, and look for value, and ensure those moments connect seamlessly to purchase. Use agents to reduce uncertainty earlier in the journey. Put deal-hunting, review interpretation, and personal shopping support where it will help consumers decide, not only where it deflects service volume.

Put deal-hunting, review interpretation, and personal shopping support where it will help consumers decide, not only where it deflects service volume. Make data readiness and testing non-negotiable. With more than half of surveyed brand executives (54%) reporting persistent challenges across channels and systems, aligning product and policy truth and testing end-to-end is essential.

With more than half of surveyed brand executives (54%) reporting persistent challenges across channels and systems, aligning product and policy truth and testing end-to-end is essential. Amplify what makes the brand distinctive. Use AI to scale relevance and remove friction while preserving creativity and authentic brand expression.

Use AI to scale relevance and remove friction while preserving creativity and authentic brand expression. Invest in AI skills and partnerships. More than half of executives (51%) cite limited AI expertise, underscoring the need to strengthen internal capabilities while partnering strategically to scale AI responsibly and effectively.

AI is reshaping where, when, and how decisions are made across every industry. In retail, understanding AI-influenced consumer behavior will become a defining competitive advantage, separating brands and retailers that shape decisions from those that simply fulfill them.

*Study methodology

To examine how consumers and business leaders are preparing for AI-enabled shopping and agentic commerce, the IBM Institute for Business Value conducted two global surveys in Q3 2025: one of consumers and one of industry executives. The consumer survey included over 18,000 respondents from 23 countries, representing diverse shopping behaviors. The executive survey gathered insights from 200 senior leaders across retail, consumer goods, and e-commerce organizations. Respondents were segmented by engagement style, price sensitivity, and AI-related knowledge. Descriptive analyses identified key patterns, and validated statistical techniques were applied to compare priorities and assess trust-focused engagement strategies.

NVIDIA is the first to release an open reasoning VLA model designed to tackle long-tail autonomous driving challenges; NVIDIA Alpamayo family also includes simulation tools and datasets for AV development.

Alpamayo 1, AlpaSim and Physical AI Open Datasets enable the development of vehicles that perceive, reason and act with humanlike judgment — enabling developers to fine-tune, distill and test models that unlock greater safety, robustness and scalability.

With Alpamayo, mobility leaders such as JLR, Lucid and Uber, along with the AV research community including Berkeley DeepDrive, can fast-track safe, reasoning‑based level 4 deployment roadmaps.



CES—NVIDIA today unveiled the NVIDIA Alpamayo family of open AI models, simulation tools and datasets designed to accelerate the next era of safe, reasoning‑based autonomous vehicle (AV) development.

AVs must safely operate across an enormous range of driving conditions. Rare, complex scenarios, often called the “long tail,” remain some of the toughest challenges for autonomous systems to safely master. Traditional AV architectures separate perception and planning, which can limit scalability when new or unusual situations arise. Recent advances in end-to-end learning have made significant progress, but overcoming these long-tail edge cases requires models that can safely reason about cause and effect, especially when situations fall outside a model’s training experience.

The Alpamayo family introduces chain-of-thought, reasoning-based vision language action (VLA) models that bring humanlike thinking to AV decision-making. These systems can think through novel or rare scenarios step by step, improving driving capability and explainability — which is critical to scaling trust and safety in intelligent vehicles — and are underpinned by the NVIDIA Halos safety system.

“The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here — when machines begin to understand, reason and act in the real world,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Robotaxis are among the first to benefit. Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments and explain their driving decisions — it’s the foundation for safe, scalable autonomy.”

A Complete, Open Ecosystem for Reasoning‑Based Autonomy

Alpamayo integrates three foundational pillars — open models, simulation frameworks and datasets — into a cohesive, open ecosystem that any automotive developer or research team can build upon.

Rather than running directly in-vehicle, Alpamayo models serve as large-scale teacher models that developers can fine-tune and distill into the backbones of their complete AV stacks.

At CES, NVIDIA is releasing:

Alpamayo 1 : The industry’s first chain-of-thought reasoning VLA model designed for the AV research community, now on Hugging Face . With a 10-billion-parameter architecture, Alpamayo 1 uses video input to generate trajectories alongside reasoning traces, showing the logic behind each decision. Developers can adapt Alpamayo 1 into smaller runtime models for vehicle development, or use it as a foundation for AV development tools such as reasoning-based evaluators and auto-labeling systems. Alpamayo 1 provides open model weights and open-source inferencing scripts. Future models in the family will feature larger parameter counts, more detailed reasoning capabilities, more input and output flexibility, and options for commercial usage.

NVIDIA BlueField-4 powers NVIDIA Inference Context Memory Storage Platform, a new kind of AI-native storage infrastructure designed for gigascale inference, to accelerate and scale agentic AI.

The new storage processor platform is built for long-context-processing agentic AI systems with lightning-fast long- and short-term memory.

Inference Context Memory Storage Platform extends AI agents’ long-term memory and enables high-bandwidth sharing of context across clusters of rack-scale AI systems — boosting tokens per seconds and power efficiency by up to 5x.

CES—NVIDIA today announced that the NVIDIA BlueField®-4 data processor, part of the full-stack NVIDIA BlueField platform, powers NVIDIA Inference Context Memory Storage Platform, a new class of AI-native storage infrastructure for the next frontier of AI.

As AI models scale to trillions of parameters and multistep reasoning, they generate vast amounts of context data — represented by a key-value (KV) cache, critical for accuracy, user experience and continuity.

A KV cache cannot be stored on GPUs long term, as this would create a bottleneck for real-time inference in multi-agent systems. AI-native applications require a new kind of scalable infrastructure to store and share this data.

NVIDIA Inference Context Memory Storage Platform provides the infrastructure for context memory by extending GPU memory capacity, enabling high-speed sharing across nodes, boosting tokens per seconds by up to 5x and delivering up to 5x greater power efficiency compared with traditional storage.

“AI is revolutionizing the entire computing stack — and now, storage,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “AI is no longer about one-shot chatbots but intelligent collaborators that understand the physical world, reason over long horizons, stay grounded in facts, use tools to do real work, and retain both short- and long-term memory. With BlueField-4, NVIDIA and our software and hardware partners are reinventing the storage stack for the next frontier of AI.”

NVIDIA Inference Context Memory Storage Platform boosts KV cache capacity and accelerates the sharing of context across clusters of rack-scale AI systems, while persistent context for multi-turn AI agents improves responsiveness, increases AI factory throughput and supports efficient scaling of long-context, multi-agent inference.

Key capabilities of the NVIDIA BlueField-4-powered platform include:

NVIDIA Rubin cluster-level KV cache capacity, delivering the scale and efficiency required for long-context, multi-turn agentic inference.

cluster-level KV cache capacity, delivering the scale and efficiency required for long-context, multi-turn agentic inference. Up to 5x greater power efficiency than traditional storage.

Smart, accelerated sharing of KV cache across AI nodes, enabled by the NVIDIA DOCA™ framework and tightly integrated with the NVIDIA NIXL library and NVIDIA Dynamo software to maximize tokens per second, reduce time to first token and improve multi-turn responsiveness.

Hardware-accelerated KV cache placement managed by NVIDIA BlueField-4 eliminates metadata overhead, reduces data movement and ensures secure, isolated access from the GPU nodes.

Efficient data sharing and retrieval enabled by NVIDIA Spectrum-X™ Ethernet serves as the high-performance network fabric for RDMA-based access to AI-native KV cache.
