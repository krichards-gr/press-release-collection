A Front-Row Experience for Lakers Fans

Apple Immersive places viewers at the center of live events and stories as they unfold. Spectrum Front Row in Apple Immersive is directed and produced for Apple Vision Pro with a feed of up to 150mbps and seven unique viewing angles: the scorer’s table, the area beneath each basket, a high-and-wide view of the arena, the player tunnel, the broadcast booth, and a roaming courtside perspective for interviews and commentary. The broadcast team features Emmy Award-winning play-by-play commentator Mark Rogondino and three-time NBA champion and former Lakers forward Danny Green as analyst.

Spectrum Front Row in Apple Immersive brings viewers closer to each pass, shot, and block. In-game graphics, including lower thirds, player rosters, game and shot clocks, and scores, appear in 3D, as if they’re floating directly in front of the viewer. Ambisonic microphones capture Spatial Audio of the arena, so viewers hear the crisp squeaks of sneakers driving up and down the court, the swish of the net when a player drains a three-pointer, and the roar of the crowd during intense moments of gameplay. During timeouts, halftimes, and other breaks in the action, the broadcast remains live inside the arena, showcasing pregame introductions, team huddles, and even in-arena entertainment.
